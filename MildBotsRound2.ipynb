that a single man in       possession of a good fortune  must be in want of a wife         however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be       on his first entering a neighbourhood  this truth is so well       fixed in the minds of the surrounding families  that he is       considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their       daughters          my dear mr  bennet   said his lady to him one day   have you       heard that netherfield park is let at last          mr  bennet replied that he had not          but it is   returned she   for mrs  long has just been here  and       she told me all about it          mr  bennet made no answer          do not you want to know who has taken it   cried his wife       impatiently          you want to tell me  and i have no objection to hearing it          this was invitation enough          why  my dear  you must know  mrs  long says that netherfield is       taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england        that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the       place  and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr        morris immediately  that he is to take possession before       michaelmas  and some of his servants are to be in the house by       the end of next week           what is his name           bingley           is he married or single           oh  single  my dear  to be sure  a single man of large fortune        four or five thousand a year  what a fine thing for our girls           how so  how can it affect them           my dear mr  bennet   replied his wife   how can you be so       tiresome  you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of       them           is that his design in settling here           design  nonsense  how can you talk so  but it is very likely       that he may fall in love with one of them  and therefore you       must visit him as soon as he comes           i see no occasion for that  you and the girls may go  or you may       send them by themselves  which perhaps will be still better  for       as you are as handsome as any of them  mr  bingley might like you       the best of the party           my dear  you flatter me  i certainly have had my share of       beauty  but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now        when a woman has five grown up daughters  she ought to give over       thinking of her own beauty           in such cases  a woman has not often much beauty to think of           but  my dear  you must indeed go and see mr  bingley when he       comes into the neighbourhood           it is more than i engage for  i assure you           but consider your daughters  only think what an establishment it       would be for one of them  sir william and lady lucas are       determined to go  merely on that account  for in general  you       know  they visit no newcomers  indeed you must go  for it will be       impossible for us to visit him  if you do not           you are over scrupulous  surely  i dare say mr  bingley will be       very glad to see you  and i will send a few lines by you to       assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he       chooses of the girls  though i must throw in a good word for my       little lizzy           i desire you will do no such thing  lizzy is not a bit better       than the others  and i am sure she is not half so handsome as       jane  nor half so good humoured as lydia  but you are always       giving her the preference           they have none of them much to recommend them   replied he         they are all silly and ignorant like other girls  but lizzy has       something more of quickness than her sisters           mr  bennet  how can you abuse your own children in such a way        you take delight in vexing me  you have no compassion on my poor       nerves           you mistake me  my dear  i have a high respect for your nerves        they are my old friends  i have heard you mention them with       consideration these twenty years at least           ah  you do not know what i suffer           but i hope you will get over it  and live to see many young men       of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood           it will be no use to us  if twenty such should come  since you       will not visit them           depend upon it  my dear  that when there are twenty  i will       visit them all          mr  bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts  sarcastic humour        reserve  and caprice  that the experience of three and twenty       years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his       character  her mind was less difficult to develop  she was a       woman of mean understanding  little information  and uncertain       temper  when she was discontented  she fancied herself nervous        the business of her life was to get her daughters married  its       solace was visiting and news              mr  bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr        bingley  he had always intended to visit him  though to the last       always assuring his wife that he should not go  and till the       evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it  it       was then disclosed in the following manner  observing his second       daughter employed in trimming a hat  he suddenly addressed her       with          i hope mr  bingley will like it  lizzy           we are not in a way to know what mr  bingley likes   said her       mother resentfully   since we are not to visit           but you forget  mamma   said elizabeth   that we shall meet him       at the assemblies  and that mrs  long has promised to introduce him           i do not believe mrs  long will do any such thing  she has two       nieces of her own  she is a selfish  hypocritical woman  and i       have no opinion of her           no more have i   said mr  bennet   and i am glad to find that       you do not depend on her serving you          mrs  bennet deigned not to make any reply  but  unable to contain       herself  began scolding one of her daughters          don t keep coughing so  kitty  for heaven s sake  have a little       compassion on my nerves  you tear them to pieces           kitty has no discretion in her coughs   said her father   she       times them ill           i do not cough for my own amusement   replied kitty fretfully         when is your next ball to be  lizzy           to morrow fortnight           aye  so it is   cried her mother   and mrs  long does not come       back till the day before  so  it will be impossible for her to       introduce him  for she will not know him herself           then  my dear  you may have the advantage of your friend  and       introduce mr  bingley to her           impossible  mr  bennet  impossible  when i am not acquainted       with him myself  how can you be so teasing           i honour your circumspection  a fortnight s acquaintance is       certainly very little  one cannot know what a man really is by       the end of a fortnight  but if we do not venture somebody else       will  and after all  mrs  long and her nieces must stand their       chance  and  therefore  as she will think it an act of kindness        if you decline the office  i will take it on myself          the girls stared at their father  mrs  bennet said only         nonsense  nonsense           what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation   cried he         do you consider the forms of introduction  and the stress that       is laid on them  as nonsense  i cannot quite agree with you       there  what say you  mary  for you are a young lady of deep       reflection  i know  and read great books and make extracts          mary wished to say something very sensible  but knew not how          while mary is adjusting her ideas   he continued   let us return       to mr  bingley           i am sick of mr  bingley   cried his wife          i am sorry to hear that  but why did not you tell me so       before  if i had known as much this morning  i certainly would not       have called on him  it is very unlucky  but as i have actually       paid the visit  we cannot escape the acquaintance now          the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished  that of       mrs  bennet perhaps surpassing the rest  though when the first       tumult of joy was over  she began to declare that it was what she       had expected all the while          how good it was in you  my dear mr  bennet  but i knew i should       persuade you at last  i was sure you loved your girls too well to       neglect such an acquaintance  well  how pleased i am  and it is       such a good joke  too  that you should have gone this morning  and       never said a word about it till now           now  kitty  you may cough as much as you choose   said mr        bennet  and  as he spoke  he left the room  fatigued with the       raptures of his wife          what an excellent father you have  girls   said she  when the       door was shut   i do not know how you will ever make him amends       for his kindness  or me either  for that matter  at our time of       life  it is not so pleasant  i can tell you  to be making new       acquaintance every day  but for your sakes  we would do       anything  lydia  my love  though you are the youngest  i dare       say mr  bingley will dance with you at the next ball           oh   said lydia stoutly   i am not afraid  for though i am the       youngest  i m the tallest          the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he       would return mr  bennet s visit  and determining when they should       ask him to dinner              not all that mrs  bennet  however  with the assistance of her       five daughters  could ask on the subject  was sufficient to draw       from her husband any satisfactory description of mr  bingley        they attacked him in various ways  with barefaced questions        ingenious suppositions  and distant surmises  but he eluded the       skill of them all  and they were at last obliged to accept the       second hand intelligence of their neighbour  lady lucas  her       report was highly favourable  sir william had been delighted with       him  he was quite young  wonderfully handsome  extremely       agreeable  and  to crown the whole  he meant to be at the next       assembly with a large party  nothing could be more delightful  to       be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love        and very lively hopes of mr  bingley s heart were entertained          if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at       netherfield   said mrs  bennet to her husband   and all the       others equally well married  i shall have nothing to wish for          in a few days mr  bingley returned mr  bennet s visit  and sat       about ten minutes with him in his library  he had entertained       hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies  of whose       beauty he had heard much  but he saw only the father  the ladies       were somewhat more fortunate  for they had the advantage of       ascertaining from an upper window  that he wore a blue coat and       rode a black horse         an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched  and       already had mrs  bennet planned the courses that were to do       credit to her housekeeping  when an answer arrived which deferred       it all  mr  bingley was obliged to be in town the following day        and consequently unable to accept the honour of their       invitation  etc  mrs  bennet was quite disconcerted  she could       not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his       arrival in hertfordshire  and she began to fear that he might be       always flying about from one place to another  and never settled       at netherfield as he ought to be  lady lucas quieted her fears a       little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to       get a large party for the ball  and a report soon followed that       mr  bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with       him to the assembly  the girls grieved over such a number of       ladies  but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing        that instead of twelve  he had brought only six with him from       london  his five sisters and a cousin  and when the party entered       the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether  mr        bingley  his two sisters  the husband of the eldest  and another       young man         mr  bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike  he had a pleasant       countenance  and easy  unaffected manners  his sisters were fine       women  with an air of decided fashion  his brother in law  mr        hurst  merely looked the gentleman  but his friend mr  darcy soon       drew the attention of the room by his fine  tall person  handsome       features  noble mien  and the report which was in general       circulation within five minutes after his entrance  of his having       ten thousand a year  the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine       figure of a man  the ladies declared he was much handsomer than       mr  bingley  and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening  till his manners gave a disgust which turned       the tide of his popularity  for he was discovered to be proud  to       be above his company  and above being pleased  and not all his       large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most       forbidding  disagreeable countenance  and being unworthy to be       compared with his friend         mr  bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the       principal people in the room  he was lively and unreserved        danced every dance  was angry that the ball closed so early  and       talked of giving one himself at netherfield  such amiable       qualities must speak for themselves  what a contrast between him       and his friend  mr  darcy danced only once with mrs  hurst and       once with miss bingley  declined being introduced to any other       lady  and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the       room  speaking occasionally to one of his own party  his       character was decided  he was the proudest  most disagreeable man       in the world  and everybody hoped that he would never come there       again  amongst the most violent against him was mrs  bennet        whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into       particular resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters         elizabeth bennet had been obliged  by the scarcity of gentlemen        to sit down for two dances  and during part of that time  mr        darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a       conversation between him and mr  bingley  who came from the dance       for a few minutes  to press his friend to join it          come  darcy   said he   i must have you dance  i hate to see you       standing about by yourself in this stupid manner  you had much       better dance           i certainly shall not  you know how i detest it  unless i am       particularly acquainted with my partner  at such an assembly as       this  it would be insupportable  your sisters are engaged  and       there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a       punishment to me to stand up with           i would not be so fastidious as you are   cried bingley         for a kingdom  upon my honour  i never met with so many pleasant       girls in my life as i have this evening  and there are several of       them you see uncommonly pretty           you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room   said       mr  darcy  looking at the eldest miss bennet          oh  she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld  but there       is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you  who is very       pretty  and i dare say very agreeable  do let me ask my partner       to introduce you           which do you mean   and turning round  he looked for a moment at       elizabeth  till catching her eye  he withdrew his own and coldly       said   she is tolerable  but not handsome enough to tempt me  and i       am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies       who are slighted by other men  you had better return to your       partner and enjoy her smiles  for you are wasting your time with       me          mr  bingley followed his advice  mr  darcy walked off  and       elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him  she       told the story  however  with great spirit among her friends  for       she had a lively  playful disposition  which delighted in       anything ridiculous         the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family        mrs  bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the       netherfield party  mr  bingley had danced with her twice  and she       had been distinguished by his sisters  jane was as much gratified       by this as her mother could be  though in a quieter way        elizabeth felt jane s pleasure  mary had heard herself mentioned       to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the       neighbourhood  and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough       to be never without partners  which was all that they had yet       learnt to care for at a ball  they returned  therefore  in good       spirits to longbourn  the village where they lived  and of which       they were the principal inhabitants  they found mr  bennet still       up  with a book he was regardless of time  and on the present       occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an       evening which had raised such splendid expectations  he had       rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be       disappointed  but he soon found that he had a very different story       to hear          oh  my dear mr  bennet   as she entered the room   we have had a       most delightful evening  a most excellent ball  i wish you had       been there  jane was so admired  nothing could be like it        everybody said how well she looked  and mr  bingley thought her       quite beautiful  and danced with her twice  only think of that        my dear  he actually danced with her twice  and she was the only       creature in the room that he asked a second time  first of all        he asked miss lucas  i was so vexed to see him stand up with her        but  however  he did not admire her at all  indeed  nobody can        you know  and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going       down the dance  so he enquired who she was  and got introduced        and asked her for the two next  then  the two third he danced with       miss king  and the two fourth with maria lucas  and the two fifth       with jane again  and the two sixth with lizzy  and the       boulanger           if he had had any compassion for me   cried her husband       impatiently   he would not have danced half so much  for god s       sake  say no more of his partners  oh that he had sprained his       ankle in the first dance           oh  my dear   continued mrs  bennet   i am quite delighted with him  he is so excessively       handsome  and his sisters are charming women  i never in my life       saw anything more elegant than their dresses  i dare say the lace       upon mrs  hurst s gown          here she was interrupted again  mr  bennet protested against any       description of finery  she was therefore obliged to seek another       branch of the subject  and related  with much bitterness of       spirit and some exaggeration  the shocking rudeness of mr  darcy          but i can assure you   she added   that lizzy does not lose much       by not suiting his fancy  for he is a most disagreeable  horrid       man  not at all worth pleasing  so high and so conceited that       there was no enduring him  he walked here  and he walked there        fancying himself so very great  not handsome enough to dance       with  i wish you had been there  my dear  to have given him one       of your set downs  i quite detest the man               when jane and elizabeth were alone  the former  who had been       cautious in her praise of mr  bingley before  expressed to her       sister how very much she admired him          he is just what a young man ought to be   said she   sensible        good humoured  lively  and i never saw such happy manners  so       much ease  with such perfect good breeding           he is also handsome   replied elizabeth   which a young man       ought likewise to be  if he possibly can  his character is       thereby complete           i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second       time  i did not expect such a compliment           did not you  i did for you  but that is one great difference       between us  compliments always take you by surprise  and me       never  what could be more natural than his asking you again  he       could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as       every other woman in the room  no thanks to his gallantry for       that  well  he certainly is very agreeable  and i give you leave       to like him  you have liked many a stupider person           dear lizzy           oh  you are a great deal too apt  you know  to like people in       general  you never see a fault in anybody  all the world are good       and agreeable in your eyes  i never heard you speak ill of a       human being in my life           i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one  but i always       speak what i think           i know you do  and it is that which makes the wonder  with       your good sense  to be so honestly blind to the follies and       nonsense of others  affectation of candour is common enough  one       meets with it everywhere  but to be candid without ostentation or       design to take the good of everybody s character and make it       still better  and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone        and so  you like this man s sisters  too  do you  their manners       are not equal to his           certainly not  at first  but they are very pleasing women when       you converse with them  miss bingley is to live with her brother        and keep his house  and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a       very charming neighbour in her          elizabeth listened in silence  but was not convinced  their       behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in       general  and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy       of temper than her sister  and with a judgment too unassailed by       any attention to herself  she was very little disposed to approve       them  they were in fact very fine ladies  not deficient in good       humour when they were pleased  nor in the power of       being agreeable where they chose it  but proud and conceited        they were rather handsome  had been educated in one of the first       private seminaries in town  had a fortune of twenty thousand       pounds  were in the habit of spending more than they ought  and       of associating with people of rank  and were therefore in every       respect entitled to think well of themselves  and meanly of       others  they were of a respectable family in the north of       england  a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories       than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired       by trade         mr  bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred       thousand pounds from his father  who had intended to purchase an       estate  but did not live to do it  mr  bingley intended it       likewise  and sometimes made choice of his county  but as he was       now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor  it was       doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his       temper  whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at       netherfield  and leave the next generation to purchase         his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own        but though he was now established only as a tenant  miss bingley       was by no means unwilling to preside at his table  nor was mrs        hurst  who had married a man of more fashion than fortune  less       disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her        mr  bingley had not been of age two years  when he was tempted by       an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house  he did       look at it  and into it for half an hour  was pleased with the       situation and the principal rooms  satisfied with what the owner       said in its praise  and took it immediately         between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship  in       spite of great opposition of character  bingley was endeared to       darcy by the easiness  openness  and ductility of his temper        though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own        and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied  on the       strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance  and       of his judgment the highest opinion  in understanding  darcy was       the superior  bingley was by no means deficient  but darcy was       clever  he was at the same time haughty  reserved  and       fastidious  and his manners  though well bred  were not inviting        in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage  bingley was       sure of being liked wherever he appeared  darcy was continually       giving offence         the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was       sufficiently characteristic  bingley had never met with       pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life  everybody had been       most kind and attentive to him  there had been no formality  no       stiffness  he had soon felt acquainted with all the room  and as       to miss bennet  he could not conceive an angel more beautiful        darcy  on the contrary  had seen a collection of people in whom       there was little beauty and no fashion  for none of whom he had       felt the smallest interest  and from none received either       attention or pleasure  miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty        but she smiled too much         mrs  hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they       admired her and liked her  and pronounced her to be a sweet girl        and one whom they should not object to know more of  miss bennet       was therefore established as a sweet girl  and their brother felt       authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose              within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the       bennets were particularly intimate  sir william lucas had been       formerly in trade in meryton  where he had made a tolerable       fortune  and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to       the king during his mayoralty  the distinction had perhaps been       felt too strongly  it had given him a disgust to his business       and to his residence in a small market town  and  quitting       them both  he had removed with his family to a house about a mile       from meryton  denominated from that period lucas lodge  where he       could think with pleasure of his own importance  and  unshackled       by business  occupy himself solely in being civil to all the       world  for  though elated by his rank  it did not render him       supercilious  on the contrary  he was all attention to everybody        by nature inoffensive  friendly  and obliging  his presentation       at st  james s had made him courteous         lady lucas was a very good kind of woman  not too clever to be a       valuable neighbour to mrs  bennet  they had several children  the       eldest of them  a sensible  intelligent young woman  about       twenty seven  was elizabeth s intimate friend         that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk       over a ball was absolutely necessary  and the morning after the       assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to       communicate          you began the evening well  charlotte   said mrs  bennet with       civil self command to miss lucas   you were mr  bingley s first       choice           yes  but he seemed to like his second better           oh  you mean jane  i suppose  because he danced with her twice        to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather       believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know       what something about mr  robinson           perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr  robinson        did not i mention it to you  mr  robinson s asking him how he       liked our meryton assemblies  and whether he did not think there       were a great many pretty women in the room  and which he       thought the prettiest  and his answering immediately to the last       question  oh  the eldest miss bennet  beyond a doubt  there       cannot be two opinions on that point            upon my word  well  that was very decided indeed that does seem       as if but  however  it may all come to nothing  you know           my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours  eliza         said charlotte   mr  darcy is not so well worth listening to as       his friend  is he  poor eliza  to be only just tolerable           i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his       ill treatment  for he is such a disagreeable man that it would       be quite a misfortune to be liked by him  mrs  long told me last       night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once       opening his lips           are you quite sure  ma am  is not there a little mistake   said       jane   i certainly saw mr  darcy speaking to her           aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield  and       he could not help answering her  but she said he seemed very       angry at being spoke to           miss bingley told me   said jane   that he never speaks much       unless among his intimate acquaintance  with them he is       remarkably agreeable           i do not believe a word of it  my dear  if he had been so very       agreeable  he would have talked to mrs  long  but i can guess how       it was  everybody says that he is eat up with pride  and i dare       say he had heard somehow that mrs  long does not keep a carriage        and had come to the ball in a hack chaise           i do not mind his not talking to mrs  long   said miss lucas         but i wish he had danced with eliza           another time  lizzy   said her mother   i would not dance with       him  if i were you           i believe  ma am  i may safely promise you never to dance with       him           his pride   said miss lucas   does not offend me so much as       pride often does  because there is an excuse for it  one cannot       wonder that so very fine a young man  with family  fortune        everything in his favour  should think highly of himself  if i       may so express it  he has a right to be proud           that is very true   replied elizabeth   and i could easily       forgive his pride  if he had not mortified mine           pride   observed mary  who piqued herself upon the solidity of       her reflections   is a very common failing  i believe  by all       that i have ever read  i am convinced that it is very common       indeed  that human nature is particularly prone to it  and that       there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of       self complacency on the score of some quality or other  real or       imaginary  vanity and pride are different things  though the       words are often used synonymously  a person may be proud without       being vain  pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves        vanity to what we would have others think of us           if i were as rich as mr  darcy   cried a young lucas  who came       with his sisters   i should not care how proud i was  i would       keep a pack of foxhounds  and drink a bottle of wine every day           then you would drink a great deal more than you ought   said       mrs  bennet   and if i were to see you at it  i should take away       your bottle directly          the boy protested that she should not  she continued to declare       that she would  and the argument ended only with the visit              the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield  the       visit was returned in due form  miss bennet s pleasing       manners grew on the goodwill of mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and       though the mother was found to be intolerable  and the younger       sisters not worth speaking to  a wish of being better acquainted       with them was expressed towards the two eldest  by jane this       attention was received with the greatest pleasure  but elizabeth       still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody        hardly excepting even her sister  and could not like them  though       their kindness to jane  such as it was  had a value as arising in       all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration        it was generally evident whenever they met  that he did admire       her  and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to       the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the       first  and was in a way to be very much in love  but she       considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered       by the world in general  since jane united with great strength       of feeling  a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of       manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the       impertinent  she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas          it may perhaps be pleasant   replied charlotte   to be able to       impose on the public in such a case  but it is sometimes a       disadvantage to be so very guarded  if a woman conceals her       affection with the same skill from the object of it  she may lose       the opportunity of fixing him  and it will then be but poor       consolation to believe the world equally in the dark  there is so       much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment  that it       is not safe to leave any to itself  we can all begin freely a       slight preference is natural enough  but there are very few of us       who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement        in nine cases out of ten  a woman had better show more affection       than she feels  bingley likes your sister undoubtedly  but he may       never do more than like her  if she does not help him on           but she does help him on  as much as her nature will allow  if       i can perceive her regard for him  he must be a simpleton       indeed not to discover it too           remember  eliza  that he does not know jane s disposition as you       do           but if a woman is partial to a man  and does not endeavour to       conceal it  he must find it out           perhaps he must  if he sees enough of her  but though bingley       and jane meet tolerably often  it is never for many hours       together  and as they always see each other in large mixed       parties  it is impossible that every moment should be employed in       conversing together  jane should therefore make the most of every       half hour in which she can command his attention  when she is       secure of him  there will be leisure for falling in love as       much as she chooses           your plan is a good one   replied elizabeth   where nothing is       in question but the desire of being well married  and if i were       determined to get a rich husband  or any husband  i dare say i       should adopt it  but these are not jane s feelings  she is not       acting by design  as yet  she cannot even be certain of the       degree of her own regard  nor of its reasonableness  she has known       him only a fortnight  she danced four dances with him at meryton        she saw him one morning at his own house  and has since dined       in company with him four times  this is not quite enough to make       her understand his character           not as you represent it  had she merely dined with him  she       might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite  but       you must remember that four evenings have been also spent       together and four evenings may do a great deal           yes  these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that       they both like vingt un better than commerce  but with respect to       any other leading characteristic  i do not imagine that much has       been unfolded           well   said charlotte   i wish jane success with all my heart        and if she were married to him to morrow  i should think she had       as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his       character for a twelvemonth  happiness in marriage is entirely a       matter of chance  if the dispositions of the parties are ever so       well known to each other  or ever so similar beforehand  it does       not advance their felicity in the least  they always continue to       grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of       vexation  and it is better to know as little as possible of the       defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life           you make me laugh  charlotte  but it is not sound  you know it       is not sound  and that you would never act in this way yourself          occupied in observing mr  bingley s attentions to her sister        elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming       an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend  mr  darcy       had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty  he had looked at       her without admiration at the ball  and when they next met  he       looked at her only to criticise  but no sooner had he made it       clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good       feature in her face  than he began to find it was rendered       uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark       eyes  to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying        though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure       of perfect symmetry in her form  he was forced to acknowledge her       figure to be light and pleasing  and in spite of his asserting       that her manners were not those of the fashionable world  he was       caught by their easy playfulness  of this she was perfectly       unaware  to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable       nowhere  and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance       with         he began to wish to know more of her  and as a step towards       conversing with her himself  attended to her conversation with       others  his doing so drew her notice  it was at sir william       lucas s  where a large party were assembled          what does mr  darcy mean   said she to charlotte   by listening       to my conversation with colonel forster           that is a question which mr  darcy only can answer           but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i       see what he is about  he has a very satirical eye  and if i do       not begin by being impertinent myself  i shall soon grow afraid       of him          on his approaching them soon afterwards  though without seeming       to have any intention of speaking  miss lucas defied her friend       to mention such a subject to him  which immediately provoking       elizabeth to do it  she turned to him and said          did not you think  mr  darcy  that i expressed myself uncommonly       well just now  when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a       ball at meryton           with great energy  but it is a subject which always makes a lady       energetic           you are severe on us           it will be her turn soon to be teased   said miss lucas   i am       going to open the instrument  eliza  and you know what follows           you are a very strange creature by way of a friend  always       wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody  if my       vanity had taken a musical turn  you would have been invaluable        but as it is  i would really rather not sit down before those who       must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers   on       miss lucas s persevering  however  she added   very well  if it       must be so  it must   and gravely glancing at mr  darcy   there       is a fine old saying  which everybody here is of course familiar       with  keep your breath to cool your porridge   and i shall keep       mine to swell my song          her performance was pleasing  though by no means capital  after a       song or two  and before she could reply to the entreaties of       several that she would sing again  she was eagerly succeeded at       the instrument by her sister mary  who having  in consequence of       being the only plain one in the family  worked hard for knowledge       and accomplishments  was always impatient for display         mary had neither genius nor taste  and though vanity had given       her application  it had given her likewise a pedantic air and       conceited manner  which would have injured a higher degree of       excellence than she had reached  elizabeth  easy and unaffected        had been listened to with much more pleasure  though not playing       half so well  and mary  at the end of a long concerto  was glad       to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs  at the       request of her younger sisters  who with some of the lucases        and two or three officers  joined eagerly in dancing at one end       of the room         mr  darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of       passing the evening  to the exclusion of all conversation  and       was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir       william lucas was his neighbour  till sir william thus began          what a charming amusement for young people this is  mr  darcy        there is nothing like dancing after all  i consider it as one of       the first refinements of polished societies           certainly  sir  and it has the advantage also of being in vogue       amongst the less polished societies of the world  every savage       can dance          sir william only smiled   your friend performs delightfully   he       continued after a pause  on seeing bingley join the group   and i       doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself  mr        darcy           you saw me dance at meryton  i believe  sir           yes  indeed  and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the       sight  do you often dance at st  james s           never  sir           do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place           it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid       it           you have a house in town  i conclude          mr  darcy bowed          i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am       fond of superior society  but i did not feel quite certain that       the air of london would agree with lady lucas          he paused in hopes of an answer  but his companion was not       disposed to make any  and elizabeth at that instant moving       towards them  he was struck with the notion of doing a very       gallant thing  and called out to her          my dear miss eliza  why are not you dancing  mr  darcy  you must       allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable       partner  you cannot refuse to dance  i am sure  when so much       beauty is before you   and  taking her hand  he would have given       it to mr  darcy  who  though extremely surprised  was not       unwilling to receive it  when she instantly drew back  and said       with some discomposure to sir william          indeed  sir  i have not the least intention of dancing  i       entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg       for a partner          mr  darcy  with grave propriety  requested to be allowed the       honour of her hand  but in vain  elizabeth was determined  nor       did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at       persuasion          you excel so much in the dance  miss eliza  that it is cruel to       deny me the happiness of seeing you  and though this gentleman       dislikes the amusement in general  he can have no objection  i am       sure  to oblige us for one half hour           mr  darcy is all politeness   said elizabeth  smiling          he is  indeed but  considering the inducement  my dear miss       eliza  we cannot wonder at his complaisance  for who would object       to such a partner          elizabeth looked archly  and turned away  her resistance had not       injured her with the gentleman  and he was thinking of her with       some complacency  when thus accosted by miss bingley          i can guess the subject of your reverie           i should imagine not           you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many       evenings in this manner in such society  and indeed i am quite of       your opinion  i was never more annoyed  the insipidity  and yet       the noise  the nothingness  and yet the self importance of all       these people  what would i give to hear your strictures on them           your conjecture is totally wrong  i assure you  my mind was more       agreeably engaged  i have been meditating on the very great       pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman       can bestow          miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face  and desired       he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such       reflections  mr  darcy replied with great intrepidity          miss elizabeth bennet           miss elizabeth bennet   repeated miss bingley   i am all       astonishment  how long has she been such a favourite  and pray       when am i to wish you joy           that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask  a       lady s imagination is very rapid  it jumps from admiration to       love  from love to matrimony  in a moment  i knew you would be       wishing me joy           nay  if you are so serious about it  i shall consider the matter as       absolutely settled  you will have a charming mother in law        indeed  and of course she will be always at pemberley with       you          he listened to her with perfect indifference  while she chose to       entertain herself in this manner  and as his composure convinced       her that all was safe  her wit flowed long              mr  bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of       two thousand a year  which  unfortunately for his daughters  was       entailed  in default of heirs male  on a distant relation  and       their mother s fortune  though ample for her situation in life        could but ill supply the deficiency of his  her father had been       an attorney in meryton  and had left her four thousand pounds         she had a sister married to a mr  phillips  who had been a clerk       to their father  and succeeded him in the business  and a brother       settled in london in a respectable line of trade         the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton  a most       convenient distance for the young ladies  who were usually       tempted thither three or four times a week  to pay their duty to       their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way  the two       youngest of the family  catherine and lydia  were particularly       frequent in these attentions  their minds were more vacant than       their sisters   and when nothing better offered  a walk to       meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish       conversation for the evening  and however bare of news the       country in general might be  they always contrived to learn some       from their aunt  at present  indeed  they were well supplied both       with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia       regiment in the neighbourhood  it was to remain the whole winter        and meryton was the headquarters         their visits to mrs  philips were now productive of the most       interesting intelligence  every day added something to their       knowledge of the officers  names and connections  their lodgings       were not long a secret  and at length they began to know the       officers themselves  mr  philips visited them all  and this       opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before  they       could talk of nothing but officers  and mr  bingley s large       fortune  the mention of which gave animation to their mother  was       worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an       ensign         after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject        mr  bennet coolly observed          from all that i can collect by your manner of talking  you must       be two of the silliest girls in the country  i have suspected it       some time  but i am now convinced          catherine was disconcerted  and made no answer  but lydia  with       perfect indifference  continued to express her admiration of       captain carter  and her hope of seeing him in the course of the       day  as he was going the next morning to london          i am astonished  my dear   said mrs  bennet   that you should be       so ready to think your own children silly  if i wished to think       slightingly of anybody s children  it should not be of my own        however           if my children are silly  i must hope to be always sensible of       it           yes but as it happens  they are all of them very clever           this is the only point  i flatter myself  on which we do not       agree  i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every       particular  but i must so far differ from you as to think our two       youngest daughters uncommonly foolish           my dear mr  bennet  you must not expect such girls to have the       sense of their father and mother  when they get to our age  i       dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do        i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and        indeed  so i do still at my heart  and if a smart young colonel        with five or six thousand a year  should want one of my girls  i       shall not say nay to him  and i thought colonel forster looked       very becoming the other night at sir william s in his       regimentals           mamma   cried lydia   my aunt says that colonel forster and       captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did       when they first came  she sees them now very often standing in       clarke s library          mrs  bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman       with a note for miss bennet  it came from netherfield  and the       servant waited for an answer  mrs  bennet s eyes sparkled with       pleasure  and she was eagerly calling out  while her daughter       read          well  jane  who is it from  what is it about  what does he say        well  jane  make haste and tell us  make haste  my love           it is from miss bingley   said jane  and then read it aloud          my dear friend          if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa       and me  we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest       of our lives  for a whole day s tête à tête between two women       can never end without a quarrel  come as soon as you can on the       receipt of this  my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with       the officers  yours ever          caroline bingley          with the officers   cried lydia   i wonder my aunt did not tell       us of that           dining out   said mrs  bennet   that is very unlucky           can i have the carriage   said jane          no  my dear  you had better go on horseback  because it seems       likely to rain  and then you must stay all night           that would be a good scheme   said elizabeth   if you were sure       that they would not offer to send her home           oh  but the gentlemen will have mr  bingley s chaise to go to       meryton  and the hursts have no horses to theirs           i had much rather go in the coach           but  my dear  your father cannot spare the horses  i am sure        they are wanted in the farm  mr  bennet  are not they           they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them           but if you have got them to day   said elizabeth   my mother s       purpose will be answered          she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the       horses were engaged  jane was therefore obliged to go on       horseback  and her mother attended her to the door with many       cheerful prognostics of a bad day  her hopes were answered  jane       had not been gone long before it rained hard  her sisters were       uneasy for her  but her mother was delighted  the rain continued       the whole evening without intermission  jane certainly could not       come back          this was a lucky idea of mine  indeed   said mrs  bennet  more       than once  as if the credit of making it rain were all her own        till the next morning  however  she was not aware of all the       felicity of her contrivance  breakfast was scarcely over when a       servant from netherfield brought the following note for       elizabeth          my dearest lizzy          i find myself very unwell this morning  which  i suppose  is to       be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday  my kind friends       will not hear of my returning home till i am better  they insist also       on my seeing mr  jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should       hear of his having been to me and  excepting a sore throat and       headache  there is not much the matter with me  yours   c           well  my dear   said mr  bennet  when elizabeth had read the       note aloud   if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of       illness if she should die  it would be a comfort to know that it       was all in pursuit of mr  bingley  and under your orders           oh  i am not at all afraid of her dying  people do not die of little       trifling colds  she will be taken good care of  as long as she       stays there  it is all very well  i would go and see her if i       could have the carriage          elizabeth  feeling really anxious  was determined to go to her        though the carriage was not to be had  and as she was no       horsewoman  walking was her only alternative  she declared her       resolution          how can you be so silly   cried her mother   as to think of such       a thing  in all this dirt  you will not be fit to be seen when       you get there           i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want           is this a hint to me  lizzy   said her father   to send for the       horses           no  indeed  i do not wish to avoid the walk  the distance is       nothing  when one has a motive  only three miles  i shall be back       by dinner           i admire the activity of your benevolence   observed mary   but       every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason  and  in my       opinion  exertion should always be in proportion to what is       required           we will go as far as meryton with you   said catherine and       lydia  elizabeth accepted their company  and the three young       ladies set off together          if we make haste   said lydia  as they walked along   perhaps we       may see something of captain carter before he goes          in meryton they parted  the two youngest repaired to the lodgings       of one of the officers  wives  and elizabeth continued her walk       alone  crossing field after field at a quick pace  jumping over       stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity  and       finding herself at last within view of the house  with weary       ankles  dirty stockings  and a face glowing with the warmth of       exercise         she was shown into the breakfast parlour  where all but jane were       assembled  and where her appearance created a great deal of       surprise  that she should have walked three miles so early in the       day  in such dirty weather  and by herself  was almost incredible       to mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and elizabeth was convinced that       they held her in contempt for it  she was received  however  very       politely by them  and in their brother s manners there was       something better than politeness  there was good humour and       kindness  mr  darcy said very little  and mr  hurst nothing at       all  the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy       which exercise had given to her complexion  and doubt as to the       occasion s justifying her coming so far alone  the latter was       thinking only of his breakfast         her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered        miss bennet had slept ill  and though up  was very feverish  and       not well enough to leave her room  elizabeth was glad to be taken       to her immediately  and jane  who had only been withheld by the       fear of giving alarm or inconvenience  from expressing in her note       how much she longed for such a visit  was delighted at her       entrance  she was not equal  however  to much conversation  and       when miss bingley left them together  could attempt little       beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness       she was treated with  elizabeth silently attended her         when breakfast was over  they were joined by the sisters  and       elizabeth began to like them herself  when she saw how much       affection and solicitude they showed for jane  the apothecary       came  and having examined his patient  said  as might be       supposed  that she had caught a violent cold  and that they must       endeavour to get the better of it  advised her to return to bed        and promised her some draughts  the advice was followed readily        for the feverish symptoms increased  and her head ached acutely        elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment  nor were the other       ladies often absent  the gentlemen being out  they had in fact       nothing to do elsewhere         when the clock struck three  elizabeth felt that she must go  and       very unwillingly said so  miss bingley offered her the carriage        and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it  when jane       testified such concern in parting with her  that miss bingley was       obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to       remain at netherfield for the present  elizabeth most thankfully       consented  and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint       the family with her stay  and bring back a supply of clothes              at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress  and at half past       six elizabeth was summoned to dinner  to the civil enquiries       which then poured in  and amongst which she had the pleasure of       distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr  bingley s  she       could not make a very favourable answer  jane was by no means       better  the sisters  on hearing this  repeated three or four       times how much they were grieved  how shocking it was to have a       bad cold  and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves        and then thought no more of the matter  and their indifference       towards jane when not immediately before them  restored elizabeth       to the enjoyment of all her original dislike         their brother  indeed  was the only one of the party whom she       could regard with any complacency  his anxiety for jane was       evident  and his attentions to herself most pleasing  and they       prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed       she was considered by the others  she had very little notice from       any but him  miss bingley was engrossed by mr  darcy  her sister       scarcely less so  and as for mr  hurst  by whom elizabeth sat  he       was an indolent man  who lived only to eat  drink  and play at       cards  who  when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout        had nothing to say to her         when dinner was over  she returned directly to jane  and miss       bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room  her       manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed  a mixture of pride       and impertinence  she had no conversation  no style  no taste  no beauty        mrs  hurst thought the same  and added          she has nothing  in short  to recommend her  but being an       excellent walker  i shall never forget her appearance this       morning  she really looked almost wild           she did  indeed  louisa  i could hardly keep my countenance        very nonsensical to come at all  why must she be scampering       about the country  because her sister had a cold  her hair so       untidy  so blowsy           yes  and her petticoat  i hope you saw her petticoat  six inches       deep in mud  i am absolutely certain  and the gown which had been       let down to hide it not doing its office           your picture may be very exact  louisa   said bingley   but this       was all lost upon me  i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked       remarkably well when she came into the room this morning  her       dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice           you observed it  mr  darcy  i am sure   said miss bingley         and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your       sister make such an exhibition           certainly not           to walk three miles  or four miles  or five miles  or whatever       it is  above her ankles in dirt  and alone  quite alone  what       could she mean by it  it seems to me to show an abominable sort       of conceited independence  a most country town indifference to       decorum           it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing         said bingley          i am afraid  mr  darcy   observed miss bingley  in a half       whisper   that this adventure has rather affected your admiration       of her fine eyes           not at all   he replied   they were brightened by the exercise         a short pause followed this speech  and mrs  hurst began again          i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet  she is really a       very sweet girl  and i wish with all my heart she were well       settled  but with such a father and mother  and such low       connections  i am afraid there is no chance of it           i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in       meryton           yes  and they have another  who lives somewhere near cheapside           that is capital   added her sister  and they both laughed       heartily          if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside   cried       bingley   it would not make them one jot less agreeable           but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men       of any consideration in the world   replied darcy         to this speech bingley made no answer  but his sisters gave it       their hearty assent  and indulged their mirth for some time at       the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations         with a renewal of tenderness  however  they repaired to her room       on leaving the dining parlour  and sat with her till summoned to       coffee  she was still very poorly  and elizabeth would not quit       her at all  till late in the evening  when she had the comfort of       seeing her asleep  and when it appeared to her rather right than       pleasant that she should go downstairs herself  on entering the       drawing room she found the whole party at loo  and was       immediately invited to join them  but suspecting them to be       playing high she declined it  and making her sister the excuse        said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay       below  with a book  mr  hurst looked at her with astonishment          do you prefer reading to cards   said he   that is rather       singular           miss eliza bennet   said miss bingley   despises cards  she is a       great reader  and has no pleasure in anything else           i deserve neither such praise nor such censure   cried       elizabeth   i am not a great reader  and i have pleasure in       many things           in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure   said       bingley   and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her       quite well          elizabeth thanked him from her heart  and then walked towards a       table where a few books were lying  he immediately offered to       fetch her others  all that his library afforded          and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own       credit  but i am an idle fellow  and though i have not many  i       have more than i ever looked into          elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with       those in the room          i am astonished   said miss bingley   that my father should have       left so small a collection of books  what a delightful library       you have at pemberley  mr  darcy           it ought to be good   he replied   it has been the work of many       generations           and then you have added so much to it yourself  you are always       buying books           i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days       as these           neglect  i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the       beauties of that noble place  charles  when you build your       house  i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley           i wish it may           but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that       neighbourhood  and take pemberley for a kind of model  there is       not a finer county in england than derbyshire           with all my heart  i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will       sell it           i am talking of possibilities  charles           upon my word  caroline  i should think it more possible to get       pemberley by purchase than by imitation          elizabeth was so much caught by what passed  as to leave her       very little attention for her book  and soon laying it wholly       aside  she drew near the card table  and stationed herself       between mr  bingley and his eldest sister  to observe the game          is miss darcy much grown since the spring   said miss bingley         will she be as tall as i am           i think she will  she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s       height  or rather taller           how i long to see her again  i never met with anybody who       delighted me so much  such a countenance  such manners  and so       extremely accomplished for her age  her performance on the       pianoforte is exquisite           it is amazing to me   said bingley   how young ladies can have       patience to be so very accomplished as they all are           all young ladies accomplished  my dear charles  what do you       mean           yes  all of them  i think  they all paint tables  cover screens        and net purses  i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this        and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first       time  without being informed that she was very accomplished           your list of the common extent of accomplishments   said darcy         has too much truth  the word is applied to many a woman who       deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a       screen  but i am very far from agreeing with you in your       estimation of ladies in general  i cannot boast of knowing more       than half a dozen  in the whole range of my acquaintance  that       are really accomplished           nor i  i am sure   said miss bingley          then   observed elizabeth   you must comprehend a great deal in       your idea of an accomplished woman           yes  i do comprehend a great deal in it           oh  certainly   cried his faithful assistant   no one can be       really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is       usually met with  a woman must have a thorough knowledge of       music  singing  drawing  dancing  and the modern languages  to       deserve the word  and besides all this  she must possess a       certain something in her air and manner of walking  the tone of       her voice  her address and expressions  or the word will be but       half deserved           all this she must possess   added darcy   and to all this she       must yet add something more substantial  in the improvement of       her mind by extensive reading           i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished       women  i rather wonder now at your knowing any           are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility       of all this           i never saw such a woman  i never saw such capacity  and       taste  and application  and elegance  as you describe  united          mrs  hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice       of her implied doubt  and were both protesting that they knew       many women who answered this description  when mr  hurst called       them to order  with bitter complaints of their inattention to       what was going forward  as all conversation was thereby at an       end  elizabeth soon afterwards left the room          eliza bennet   said miss bingley  when the door was closed       on her   is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend       themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own  and with       many men  i dare say  it succeeds  but  in my opinion  it is a       paltry device  a very mean art           undoubtedly   replied darcy  to whom this remark was chiefly       addressed   there is meanness in all the arts which ladies       sometimes condescend to employ for captivation  whatever bears       affinity to cunning is despicable          miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to       continue the subject         elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was       worse  and that she could not leave her  bingley urged mr  jones s       being sent for immediately  while his sisters  convinced that no       country advice could be of any service  recommended an express to       town for one of the most eminent physicians  this she would not       hear of  but she was not so unwilling to comply with their       brother s proposal  and it was settled that mr  jones should be       sent for early in the morning  if miss bennet were not decidedly       better  bingley was quite uncomfortable  his sisters declared       that they were miserable  they solaced their wretchedness        however  by duets after supper  while he could find no better       relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions       that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her       sister              elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room  and       in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable       answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr        bingley by a housemaid  and some time afterwards from the two       elegant ladies who waited on his sisters  in spite of this       amendment  however  she requested to have a note sent to       longbourn  desiring her mother to visit jane  and form her own       judgment of her situation  the note was immediately dispatched        and its contents as quickly complied with  mrs  bennet        accompanied by her two youngest girls  reached netherfield soon       after the family breakfast         had she found jane in any apparent danger  mrs  bennet would have       been very miserable  but being satisfied on seeing her that her       illness was not alarming  she had no wish of her recovering       immediately  as her restoration to health would probably remove       her from netherfield  she would not listen  therefore  to her       daughter s proposal of being carried home  neither did the       apothecary  who arrived about the same time  think it at all       advisable  after sitting a little while with jane  on miss       bingley s appearance and invitation  the mother and three       daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour  bingley       met them with hopes that mrs  bennet had not found miss bennet       worse than she expected          indeed i have  sir   was her answer   she is a great deal too       ill to be moved  mr  jones says we must not think of moving her        we must trespass a little longer on your kindness           removed   cried bingley   it must not be thought of  my sister        i am sure  will not hear of her removal           you may depend upon it  madam   said miss bingley  with cold       civility   that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention       while she remains with us          mrs  bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments          i am sure   she added   if it was not for such good friends i do       not know what would become of her  for she is very ill indeed        and suffers a vast deal  though with the greatest patience in the       world  which is always the way with her  for she has  without       exception  the sweetest temper i ever met with  i often tell       my other girls they are nothing to her  you have a sweet room       here  mr  bingley  and a charming prospect over that gravel walk        i do not know a place in the country that is equal to       netherfield  you will not think of quitting it in a hurry  i       hope  though you have but a short lease           whatever i do is done in a hurry   replied he   and therefore if       i should resolve to quit netherfield  i should probably be off in       five minutes  at present  however  i consider myself as quite       fixed here           that is exactly what i should have supposed of you   said       elizabeth          you begin to comprehend me  do you   cried he  turning towards       her          oh  yes i understand you perfectly           i wish i might take this for a compliment  but to be so easily       seen through i am afraid is pitiful           that is as it happens  it does not necessarily follow that a deep  intricate       character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours           lizzy   cried her mother   remember where you are  and do not       run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home           i did not know before   continued bingley immediately   that you       were a studier of character  it must be an amusing study           yes  but intricate characters are the most amusing  they have       at least that advantage           the country   said darcy   can in general supply but few       subjects for such a study  in a country neighbourhood you move in       a very confined and unvarying society           but people themselves alter so much  that there is something new       to be observed in them for ever           yes  indeed   cried mrs  bennet  offended by his manner of       mentioning a country neighbourhood   i assure you there is quite       as much of that going on in the country as in town          everybody was surprised  and darcy  after looking at her for a       moment  turned silently away  mrs  bennet  who fancied she had       gained a complete victory over him  continued her triumph          i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the       country  for my part  except the shops and public places  the       country is a vast deal pleasanter  is not it  mr  bingley           when i am in the country   he replied   i never wish to leave       it  and when i am in town it is pretty much the same  they have       each their advantages  and i can be equally happy in either           aye that is because you have the right disposition  but that       gentleman   looking at darcy   seemed to think the country was       nothing at all           indeed  mama  you are mistaken   said elizabeth  blushing for       her mother   you quite mistook mr  darcy  he only meant that       there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the       country as in town  which you must acknowledge to be true           certainly  my dear  nobody said there were  but as to not       meeting with many people in this neighbourhood  i believe there       are few neighbourhoods larger  i know we dine with       four and twenty families          nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep       his countenance  his sister was less delicate  and directed her       eye towards mr  darcy with a very expressive smile  elizabeth        for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s       thoughts  now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn       since her coming away          yes  she called yesterday with her father  what an agreeable man       sir william is  mr  bingley is not he  so much the man of       fashion  so genteel and so easy  he has always something to say to       everybody  that is my idea of good breeding  and those persons       who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths        quite mistake the matter           did charlotte dine with you           no  she would go home  i fancy she was wanted about the       mince pies  for my part  mr  bingley  i always keep servants       that can do their own work  my daughters are brought up       differently  but everybody is to judge for themselves  and the       lucases are a very good sort of girls  i assure you  it is a pity       they are not handsome  not that i think charlotte so very       plain but then she is our particular friend           she seems a very pleasant young woman   said bingley          oh  dear  yes  but you must own she is very plain  lady lucas       herself has often said so  and envied me jane s beauty  i do not       like to boast of my own child  but to be sure  jane one does not       often see anybody better looking  it is what everybody says  i do       not trust my own partiality  when she was only fifteen  there was       a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her        that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before       we came away  but  however  he did not  perhaps he thought her       too young  however  he wrote some verses on her  and very pretty       they were           and so ended his affection   said elizabeth impatiently   there       has been many a one  i fancy  overcome in the same way  i wonder       who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away       love           i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love   said       darcy          of a fine  stout  healthy love it may  everything nourishes what       is strong already  but if it be only a slight  thin sort of       inclination  i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it       entirely away          darcy only smiled  and the general pause which ensued made       elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself       again  she longed to speak  but could think of nothing to say        and after a short silence mrs  bennet began repeating her thanks       to mr  bingley for his kindness to jane  with an apology for       troubling him also with lizzy  mr  bingley was unaffectedly civil       in his answer  and forced his younger sister to be civil also        and say what the occasion required  she performed her part indeed       without much graciousness  but mrs  bennet was satisfied  and       soon afterwards ordered her carriage  upon this signal  the       youngest of her daughters put herself forward  the two girls had       been whispering to each other during the whole visit  and the       result of it was  that the youngest should tax mr  bingley with       having promised on his first coming into the country to give a       ball at netherfield         lydia was a stout  well grown girl of fifteen  with a fine       complexion and good humoured countenance  a favourite with her       mother  whose affection had brought her into public at an early       age  she had high animal spirits  and a sort of natural       self consequence  which the attentions of the officers  to whom       her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended       her  had increased into assurance  she was very equal  therefore        to address mr  bingley on the subject of the ball  and abruptly       reminded him of his promise  adding  that it would be the most       shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it  his answer to       this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear          i am perfectly ready  i assure you  to keep my engagement  and       when your sister is recovered  you shall  if you please  name the       very day of the ball  but you would not wish to be dancing while       she is ill          lydia declared herself satisfied   oh  yes it would be much       better to wait till jane was well  and by that time most likely       captain carter would be at meryton again  and when you have given       your ball   she added   i shall insist on their giving one       also  i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he       does not          mrs  bennet and her daughters then departed  and elizabeth       returned instantly to jane  leaving her own and her relations        behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr  darcy  the       latter of whom  however  could not be prevailed on to join in       their censure of her  in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms       on fine eyes              the day passed much as the day before had done  mrs  hurst and       miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the       invalid  who continued  though slowly  to mend  and in the       evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room  the       loo table  however  did not appear  mr  darcy was writing  and       miss bingley  seated near him  was watching the progress of his       letter  and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to       his sister  mr  hurst and mr  bingley were at piquet  and mrs        hurst was observing their game         elizabeth took up some needlework  and was sufficiently amused in       attending to what passed between darcy and his companion  the       perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting        or on the evenness of his lines  or on the length of his letter        with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received        formed a curious dialogue  and was exactly in unison with her       opinion of each          how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter          he made no answer          you write uncommonly fast           you are mistaken  i write rather slowly           how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course       of a year  letters of business  too  how odious i should think       them           it is fortunate  then  that they fall to my lot instead of to       yours           pray tell your sister that i long to see her           i have already told her so once  by your desire           i am afraid you do not like your pen  let me mend it for you  i       mend pens remarkably well           thank you but i always mend my own           how can you contrive to write so even          he was silent          tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on       the harp  and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with       her beautiful little design for a table  and i think it       infinitely superior to miss grantley s           will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write       again  at present i have not room to do them justice           oh  it is of no consequence  i shall see her in january  but do       you always write such charming long letters to her  mr  darcy           they are generally long  but whether always charming  it is not       for me to determine           it is a rule with me  that a person who can write a long letter       with ease  cannot write ill           that will not do for a compliment to darcy  caroline   cried her       brother   because he does not write with ease  he studies too       much for words of four syllables  do not you  darcy           my style of writing is very different from yours           oh   cried miss bingley   charles writes in the most careless       way imaginable  he leaves out half his words  and blots the       rest           my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by       which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my       correspondents           your humility  mr  bingley   said elizabeth   must disarm       reproof           nothing is more deceitful   said darcy   than the appearance of       humility  it is often only carelessness of opinion  and sometimes       an indirect boast           and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of       modesty           the indirect boast  for you are really proud of your defects in       writing  because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity       of thought and carelessness of execution  which  if not       estimable  you think at least highly interesting  the power of       doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the       possessor  and often without any attention to the imperfection of       the performance  when you told mrs  bennet this morning that if       you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in       five minutes  you meant it to be a sort of panegyric  of       compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in       a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone        and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else           nay   cried bingley   this is too much  to remember at night all       the foolish things that were said in the morning  and yet  upon       my honour  i believed what i said of myself to be true  and i       believe it at this moment  at least  therefore  i did not assume       the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before       the ladies           i dare say you believed it  but i am by no means convinced that       you would be gone with such celerity  your conduct would be quite       as dependent on chance as that of any man i know  and if  as you       were mounting your horse  a friend were to say   bingley  you had       better stay till next week   you would probably do it  you would       probably not go and  at another word  might stay a month           you have only proved by this   cried elizabeth   that mr        bingley did not do justice to his own disposition  you have shown       him off now much more than he did himself           i am exceedingly gratified   said bingley   by your converting       what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my       temper  but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that       gentleman did by no means intend  for he would certainly think       the better of me  if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat       denial  and ride off as fast as i could           would mr  darcy then consider the rashness of your original       intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it           upon my word  i cannot exactly explain the matter  darcy must       speak for himself           you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call       mine  but which i have never acknowledged  allowing the case        however  to stand according to your representation  you must       remember  miss bennet  that the friend who is supposed to desire       his return to the house  and the delay of his plan  has merely       desired it  asked it without offering one argument in favour of       its propriety           to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no       merit with you           to yield without conviction is no compliment to the       understanding of either           you appear to me  mr  darcy  to allow nothing for the influence       of friendship and affection  a regard for the requester would       often make one readily yield to a request  without waiting for       arguments to reason one into it  i am not particularly speaking       of such a case as you have supposed about mr  bingley  we may as       well wait  perhaps  till the circumstance occurs  before we       discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon  but in general       and ordinary cases between friend and friend  where one of them       is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great       moment  should you think ill of that person for complying with       the desire  without waiting to be argued into it           will it not be advisable  before we proceed on this subject  to       arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which       is to appertain to this request  as well as the degree of       intimacy subsisting between the parties           by all means   cried bingley   let us hear all the particulars        not forgetting their comparative height and size  for that will       have more weight in the argument  miss bennet  than you may be       aware of  i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall       fellow  in comparison with myself  i should not pay him half so       much deference  i declare i do not know a more awful object than       darcy  on particular occasions  and in particular places  at his       own house especially  and of a sunday evening  when he has       nothing to do          mr  darcy smiled  but elizabeth thought she could perceive that       he was rather offended  and therefore checked her laugh  miss       bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received  in an       expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense          i see your design  bingley   said his friend   you dislike an       argument  and want to silence this           perhaps i do  arguments are too much like disputes  if you and       miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room  i shall       be very thankful  and then you may say whatever you like of me           what you ask   said elizabeth   is no sacrifice on my side  and       mr  darcy had much better finish his letter          mr  darcy took her advice  and did finish his letter         when that business was over  he applied to miss bingley and       elizabeth for the indulgence of some music  miss bingley moved       with alacrity to the pianoforte  and after a polite request       that elizabeth would lead the way  which the other as politely and       more earnestly negatived  she seated herself         mrs  hurst sang with her sister  and while they were thus       employed  elizabeth could not help observing  as she turned over       some music books that lay on the instrument  how frequently mr        darcy s eyes were fixed on her  she hardly knew how to suppose       that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man  and       yet that he should look at her because he disliked her  was still       more strange  she could only imagine  however  at last  that she       drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and       reprehensible  according to his ideas of right  than in any other       person present  the supposition did not pain her  she liked him       too little to care for his approbation         after playing some italian songs  miss bingley varied the charm       by a lively scotch air  and soon afterwards mr  darcy  drawing       near elizabeth  said to her          do not you feel a great inclination  miss bennet  to seize such       an opportunity of dancing a reel          she smiled  but made no answer  he repeated the question  with       some surprise at her silence          oh   said she   i heard you before  but i could not immediately       determine what to say in reply  you wanted me  i know  to say        yes   that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste        but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes  and       cheating a person of their premeditated contempt  i have        therefore  made up my mind to tell you  that i do not want to       dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare           indeed i do not dare          elizabeth  having rather expected to affront him  was amazed at       his gallantry  but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness       in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody        and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by       her  he really believed  that were it not for the inferiority of       her connections  he should be in some danger         miss bingley saw  or suspected enough to be jealous  and her       great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received       some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth         she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest  by       talking of their supposed marriage  and planning his happiness in       such an alliance          i hope   said she  as they were walking together in the       shrubbery the next day   you will give your mother in law a few       hints  when this desirable event takes place  as to the advantage       of holding her tongue  and if you can compass it  do cure the       younger girls of running after the officers  and  if i may mention so       delicate a subject  endeavour to check that little something        bordering on conceit and impertinence  which your lady       possesses           have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity           oh  yes  do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be       placed in the gallery at pemberley  put them next to your       great uncle the judge  they are in the same profession  you know        only in different lines  as for your elizabeth s picture  you       must not attempt to have it taken  for what painter could do justice to       those beautiful eyes           it would not be easy  indeed  to catch their expression  but       their colour and shape  and the eyelashes  so remarkably fine        might be copied          at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs  hurst and       elizabeth herself          i did not know that you intended to walk   said miss bingley  in       some confusion  lest they had been overheard          you used us abominably ill   answered mrs  hurst   running away       without telling us that you were coming out          then taking the disengaged arm of mr  darcy  she left elizabeth       to walk by herself  the path just admitted three  mr  darcy felt       their rudeness  and immediately said           this walk is not wide enough for our party  we had better go       into the avenue          but elizabeth  who had not the least inclination to remain with       them  laughingly answered          no  no  stay where you are  you are charmingly grouped  and       appear to uncommon advantage  the picturesque would be spoilt by       admitting a fourth  good bye          she then ran gaily off  rejoicing as she rambled about  in the       hope of being at home again in a day or two  jane was already so       much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of       hours that evening              when the ladies removed after dinner  elizabeth ran up to her       sister  and seeing her well guarded from cold  attended her into       the drawing room  where she was welcomed by her two friends with       many professions of pleasure  and elizabeth had never seen them       so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the       gentlemen appeared  their powers of conversation were       considerable  they could describe an entertainment with accuracy        relate an anecdote with humour  and laugh at their acquaintance       with spirit         but when the gentlemen entered  jane was no longer the first       object  miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned toward darcy        and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many       steps  he addressed himself to miss bennet  with a polite       congratulation  mr  hurst also made her a slight bow  and said he       was  very glad   but diffuseness and warmth remained for       bingley s salutation  he was full of joy and attention  the first       half hour was spent in piling up the fire  lest she should suffer       from the change of room  and she removed at his desire to the       other side of the fireplace  that she might be further from the       door  he then sat down by her  and talked scarcely to anyone       else  elizabeth  at work in the opposite corner  saw it all with       great delight         when tea was over  mr  hurst reminded his sister in law of the       card table but in vain  she had obtained private intelligence       that mr  darcy did not wish for cards  and mr  hurst soon found       even his open petition rejected  she assured him that no one       intended to play  and the silence of the whole party on the       subject seemed to justify her  mr  hurst had therefore nothing to       do  but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep        darcy took up a book  miss bingley did the same  and mrs  hurst        principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings        joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss       bennet         miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching       mr  darcy s progress through his book  as in reading her own        and she was perpetually either making some enquiry  or looking at       his page  she could not win him  however  to any conversation  he       merely answered her question  and read on  at length  quite       exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book  which       she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his  she       gave a great yawn and said   how pleasant it is to spend an       evening in this way  i declare after all there is no enjoyment       like reading  how much sooner one tires of anything than of a       book  when i have a house of my own  i shall be miserable if i       have not an excellent library          no one made any reply  she then yawned again  threw aside her       book  and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some       amusement  when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss       bennet  she turned suddenly towards him and said          by the bye  charles  are you really serious in meditating a       dance at netherfield  i would advise you  before you determine on       it  to consult the wishes of the present party  i am much       mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be       rather a punishment than a pleasure           if you mean darcy   cried her brother   he may go to bed  if he       chooses  before it begins but as for the ball  it is quite a       settled thing  and as soon as nicholls has made white soup       enough  i shall send round my cards           i should like balls infinitely better   she replied   if they       were carried on in a different manner  but there is something       insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting  it       would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of       dancing were made the order of the day           much more rational  my dear caroline  i dare say  but it would       not be near so much like a ball          miss bingley made no answer  and soon afterwards she got up and       walked about the room  her figure was elegant  and she walked       well  but darcy  at whom it was all aimed  was still inflexibly       studious  in the desperation of her feelings  she resolved on one       effort more  and  turning to elizabeth  said          miss eliza bennet  let me persuade you to follow my example  and       take a turn about the room  i assure you it is very refreshing       after sitting so long in one attitude          elizabeth was surprised  but agreed to it immediately  miss       bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility  mr        darcy looked up  he was as much awake to the novelty of attention       in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be  and unconsciously       closed his book  he was directly invited to join their party  but       he declined it  observing that he could imagine but two motives       for their choosing to walk up and down the room together  with       either of which motives his joining them would interfere   what       could he mean  she was dying to know what could be his       meaning   and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand       him          not at all   was her answer   but depend upon it  he means to be       severe on us  and our surest way of disappointing him will be to       ask nothing about it          miss bingley  however  was incapable of disappointing mr  darcy       in anything  and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation       of his two motives          i have not the smallest objection to explaining them   said he        as soon as she allowed him to speak   you either choose this       method of passing the evening because you are in each other s       confidence  and have secret affairs to discuss  or because you       are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage       in walking  if the first  i would be completely in your way  and       if the second  i can admire you much better as i sit by the       fire           oh  shocking   cried miss bingley   i never heard anything so       abominable  how shall we punish him for such a speech           nothing so easy  if you have but the inclination   said       elizabeth   we can all plague and punish one another  tease       him laugh at him  intimate as you are  you must know how it is to       be done           but upon my honour  i do not  i do assure you that my intimacy       has not yet taught me that  tease calmness of manner and       presence of mind  no  no  i feel he may defy us there  and as to       laughter  we will not expose ourselves  if you please  by       attempting to laugh without a subject  mr  darcy may hug       himself           mr  darcy is not to be laughed at   cried elizabeth   that is an       uncommon advantage  and uncommon i hope it will continue  for it       would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances  i       dearly love a laugh           miss bingley   said he   has given me more credit than can be        the wisest and the best of men nay  the wisest and best of their       actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object       in life is a joke           certainly   replied elizabeth  there are such people  but i hope       i am not one of them  i hope i never ridicule what is wise and       good  follies and nonsense  whims and inconsistencies  do       divert me  i own  and i laugh at them whenever i can  but these        i suppose  are precisely what you are without           perhaps that is not possible for anyone  but it has been the       study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a       strong understanding to ridicule           such as vanity and pride           yes  vanity is a weakness indeed  but pride where there is a       real superiority of mind  pride will be always under good       regulation          elizabeth turned away to hide a smile          your examination of mr  darcy is over  i presume   said miss       bingley   and pray what is the result           i am perfectly convinced by it that mr  darcy has no defect  he       owns it himself without disguise           no   said darcy   i have made no such pretension  i have faults       enough  but they are not  i hope  of understanding  my temper i       dare not vouch for  it is  i believe  too little       yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world  i       cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought        nor their offenses against myself  my feelings are not puffed       about with every attempt to move them  my temper would perhaps be       called resentful  my good opinion once lost  is lost forever           that is a failing indeed   cried elizabeth   implacable       resentment is a shade in a character  but you have chosen your       fault well  i really cannot laugh at it  you are safe from me           there is  i believe  in every disposition a tendency to some       particular evil a natural defect  which not even the best       education can overcome           and your defect is to hate everybody           and yours   he replied with a smile   is willfully to       misunderstand them           do let us have a little music   cried miss bingley  tired of a       conversation in which she had no share   louisa  you will not       mind my waking mr  hurst          her sister had not the smallest objection  and the pianoforte was       opened  and darcy  after a few moments  recollection  was not       sorry for it  he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too       much attention              in consequence of an agreement between the sisters  elizabeth       wrote the next morning to their mother  to beg that the carriage       might be sent for them in the course of the day  but mrs  bennet        who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till       the following tuesday  which would exactly finish jane s week        could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before  her       answer  therefore  was not propitious  at least not to       elizabeth s wishes  for she was impatient to get home  mrs        bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the       carriage before tuesday  and in her postscript it was added  that       if mr  bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer  she       could spare them very well  against staying longer  however        elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it       would be asked  and fearful  on the contrary  as being considered       as intruding themselves needlessly long  she urged jane to borrow       mr  bingley s carriage immediately  and at length it was settled       that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning       should be mentioned  and the request made         the communication excited many professions of concern  and enough       was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day       to work on jane  and till the morrow their going was deferred        miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay  for       her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her       affection for the other         the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to       go so soon  and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it       would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered  but       jane was firm where she felt herself to be right         to mr  darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at       netherfield long enough  she attracted him more than he liked and       miss bingley was uncivil to her  and more teasing than usual to       himself  he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no       sign of admiration should now escape him  nothing that could       elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity  sensible       that if such an idea had been suggested  his behaviour during the       last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it        steady to his purpose  he scarcely spoke ten words to her through       the whole of saturday  and though they were at one time left by       themselves for half an hour  he adhered most conscientiously to       his book  and would not even look at her         on sunday  after morning service  the separation  so agreeable to       almost all  took place  miss bingley s civility to elizabeth       increased at last very rapidly  as well as her affection for       jane  and when they parted  after assuring the latter of the       pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn       or netherfield  and embracing her most tenderly  she even shook       hands with the former  elizabeth took leave of the whole party in       the liveliest of spirits         they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother  mrs        bennet wondered at their coming  and thought them very wrong to       give so much trouble  and was sure jane would have caught cold       again  but their father  though very laconic in his expressions       of pleasure  was really glad to see them  he had felt their       importance in the family circle  the evening conversation  when       they were all assembled  had lost much of its animation  and       almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth         they found mary  as usual  deep in the study of thorough bass and       human nature  and had some extracts to admire  and some new       observations of threadbare morality to listen to  catherine and       lydia had information for them of a different sort  much had been       done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding       wednesday  several of the officers had dined lately with their       uncle  a private had been flogged  and it had actually been       hinted that colonel forster was going to be married               i hope  my dear   said mr  bennet to his wife  as they were at       breakfast the next morning   that you have ordered a good dinner       to day  because i have reason to expect an addition to our family       party           who do you mean  my dear  i know of nobody that is coming  i am       sure  unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope       my dinners are good enough for her  i do not believe she often       sees such at home           the person of whom i speak is a gentleman  and a stranger          mrs  bennet s eyes sparkled   a gentleman and a stranger  it is       mr  bingley  i am sure  well  i am sure i shall be extremely glad       to see mr  bingley  but good lord  how unlucky  there is not a       bit of fish to be got to day  lydia  my love  ring the bell i       must speak to hill this moment           it is not mr  bingley   said her husband   it is a person whom       i never saw in the whole course of my life          this roused a general astonishment  and he had the pleasure of       being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at       once         after amusing himself some time with their curiosity  he thus       explained          about a month ago i received this letter  and about a fortnight       ago i answered it  for i thought it a case of some delicacy  and       requiring early attention  it is from my cousin  mr  collins        who  when i am dead  may turn you all out of this house as soon       as he pleases           oh  my dear   cried his wife   i cannot bear to hear that       mentioned  pray do not talk of that odious man  i do think it is       the hardest thing in the world  that your estate should be       entailed away from your own children  and i am sure  if i had       been you  i should have tried long ago to do something or other       about it          jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an       entail  they had often attempted to do it before  but it was a       subject on which mrs  bennet was beyond the reach of reason  and       she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an       estate away from a family of five daughters  in favour of a man       whom nobody cared anything about          it certainly is a most iniquitous affair   said mr  bennet   and       nothing can clear mr  collins from the guilt of inheriting       longbourn  but if you will listen to his letter  you may perhaps       be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself           no  that i am sure i shall not  and i think it is very       impertinent of him to write to you at all  and very hypocritical        i hate such false friends  why could he not keep on quarreling       with you  as his father did before him           why  indeed  he does seem to have had some filial scruples on       that head  as you will hear           hunsford  near westerham  kent   october          dear sir          the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late       honoured father always gave me much uneasiness  and since i have       had the misfortune to lose him  i have frequently wished to heal       the breach  but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts        fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to       be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him       to be at variance   there  mrs  bennet   my mind  however  is now       made up on the subject  for having received ordination at easter        i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage       of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh  widow of sir       lewis de bourgh  whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to       the valuable rectory of this parish  where it shall be my earnest       endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her       ladyship  and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies       which are instituted by the church of england  as a clergyman        moreover  i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing       of peace in all families within the reach of my influence  and on       these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures are       highly commendable  and that the circumstance of my being next in       the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your       side  and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch  i       cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring       your amiable daughters  and beg leave to apologise for it  as       well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible       amends but of this hereafter  if you should have no objection to       receive me into your house  i propose myself the satisfaction of       waiting on you and your family  monday  november   by four       o clock  and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the       saturday se ennight following  which i can do without any       inconvenience  as lady catherine is far from objecting to my       occasional absence on a sunday  provided that some other       clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day  i remain  dear       sir  with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters  your       well wisher and friend          william collins          at four o clock  therefore  we may expect this peace making       gentleman   said mr  bennet  as he folded up the letter   he       seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man  upon my       word  and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance        especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him       come to us again           there is some sense in what he says about the girls  however        and if he is disposed to make them any amends  i shall not be the       person to discourage him           though it is difficult   said jane   to guess in what way he can       mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due  the wish is       certainly to his credit          elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for       lady catherine  and his kind intention of christening  marrying        and burying his parishioners whenever it were required          he must be an oddity  i think   said she   i cannot make him       out  there is something very pompous in his style  and what can       he mean by apologising for being next in the entail  we cannot       suppose he would help it if he could  could he be a sensible man        sir           no  my dear  i think not  i have great hopes of finding him       quite the reverse  there is a mixture of servility and       self importance in his letter  which promises well  i am       impatient to see him           in point of composition   said mary   the letter does not seem       defective  the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly       new  yet i think it is well expressed          to catherine and lydia  neither the letter nor its writer were in       any degree interesting  it was next to impossible that their       cousin should come in a scarlet coat  and it was now some weeks       since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any       other colour  as for their mother  mr  collins s letter had done       away much of her ill will  and she was preparing to see him with       a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters         mr  collins was punctual to his time  and was received with great       politeness by the whole family  mr  bennet indeed said little        but the ladies were ready enough to talk  and mr  collins seemed       neither in need of encouragement  nor inclined to be silent       himself  he was a tall  heavy looking young man of       five and twenty  his air was grave and stately  and his manners       were very formal  he had not been long seated before he       complimented mrs  bennet on having so fine a family of daughters        said he had heard much of their beauty  but that in this instance       fame had fallen short of the truth  and added  that he did not       doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage        this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers        but mrs  bennet  who quarreled with no compliments  answered most       readily          you are very kind  i am sure  and i wish with all my heart it       may prove so  for else they will be destitute enough  things are       settled so oddly           you allude  perhaps  to the entail of this estate           ah  sir  i do indeed  it is a grievous affair to my poor girls        you must confess  not that i mean to find fault with you  for       such things i know are all chance in this world  there is no       knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed           i am very sensible  madam  of the hardship to my fair cousins        and could say much on the subject  but that i am cautious of       appearing forward and precipitate  but i can assure the young       ladies that i come prepared to admire them  at present i will not       say more  but  perhaps  when we are better acquainted          he was interrupted by a summons to dinner  and the girls smiled       on each other  they were not the only objects of mr  collins s       admiration  the hall  the dining room  and all its furniture        were examined and praised  and his commendation of everything       would have touched mrs  bennet s heart  but for the mortifying       supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property  the       dinner too in its turn was highly admired  and he begged to know       to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was       owing  but he was set right there by mrs  bennet  who assured him       with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good       cook  and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen  he       begged pardon for having displeased her  in a softened tone she       declared herself not at all offended  but he continued to       apologise for about a quarter of an hour              during dinner  mr  bennet scarcely spoke at all  but when the       servants were withdrawn  he thought it time to have some       conversation with his guest  and therefore started a subject in       which he expected him to shine  by observing that he seemed very       fortunate in his patroness  lady catherine de bourgh s attention       to his wishes  and consideration for his comfort  appeared very       remarkable  mr  bennet could not have chosen better  mr  collins       was eloquent in her praise  the subject elevated him to more than       usual solemnity of manner  and with a most important aspect he       protested that  he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour       in a person of rank such affability and condescension  as he had       himself experienced from lady catherine  she had been graciously       pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already       had the honour of preaching before her  she had also asked him       twice to dine at rosings  and had sent for him only the saturday       before  to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening  lady       catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew  but he had       never seen anything but affability in her  she had always spoken       to him as she would to any other gentleman  she made not the       smallest objection to his joining in the society of the       neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a       week or two  to visit his relations  she had even condescended to       advise him to marry as soon as he could  provided he chose with       discretion  and had once paid him a visit in his humble       parsonage  where she had perfectly approved all the alterations       he had been making  and had even vouchsafed to suggest some       herself some shelves in the closet up stairs           that is all very proper and civil  i am sure   said mrs  bennet         and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman  it is a pity that       great ladies in general are not more like her  does she live near       you  sir           the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by       a lane from rosings park  her ladyship s residence           i think you said she was a widow  sir  has she any family           she has only one daughter  the heiress of rosings  and of very       extensive property           ah   said mrs  bennet  shaking her head   then she is better off       than many girls  and what sort of young lady is she  is she       handsome           she is a most charming young lady indeed  lady catherine herself       says that  in point of true beauty  miss de bourgh is far       superior to the handsomest of her sex  because there is that in       her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth        she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution  which has       prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments       which she could not have otherwise failed of  as i am informed by       the lady who superintended her education  and who still resides       with them  but she is perfectly amiable  and often condescends to       drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies           has she been presented  i do not remember her name among the       ladies at court           her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in       town  and by that means  as i told lady catherine one day  has       deprived the british court of its brightest ornament  her       ladyship seemed pleased with the idea  and you may imagine that i       am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate       compliments which are always acceptable to ladies  i have more       than once observed to lady catherine  that her charming daughter       seemed born to be a duchess  and that the most elevated rank        instead of giving her consequence  would be adorned by her  these       are the kind of little things which please her ladyship  and it       is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound       to pay           you judge very properly   said mr  bennet   and it is happy for       you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy  may       i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse       of the moment  or are the result of previous study           they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time  and though       i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such       little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary       occasions  i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as       possible          mr  bennet s expectations were fully answered  his cousin was as       absurd as he had hoped  and he listened to him with the keenest       enjoyment  maintaining at the same time the most resolute       composure of countenance  and  except in an occasional glance at       elizabeth  requiring no partner in his pleasure         by tea time  however  the dose had been enough  and mr  bennet       was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again  and  when       tea was over  glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies  mr        collins readily assented  and a book was produced  but  on       beholding it  for everything announced it to be from a       circulating library   he started back  and begging pardon        protested that he never read novels  kitty stared at him  and       lydia exclaimed  other books were produced  and after some       deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons  lydia gaped as he opened       the volume  and before he had  with very monotonous solemnity        read three pages  she interrupted him with          do you know  mamma  that my uncle phillips talks of turning away       richard  and if he does  colonel forster will hire him  my aunt       told me so herself on saturday  i shall walk to meryton to morrow       to hear more about it  and to ask when mr  denny comes back from       town          lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue  but       mr  collins  much offended  laid aside his book  and said          i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by       books of a serious stamp  though written solely for their       benefit  it amazes me  i confess  for  certainly  there can be       nothing so advantageous to them as instruction  but i will no       longer importune my young cousin          then turning to mr  bennet  he offered himself as his antagonist       at backgammon  mr  bennet accepted the challenge  observing that       he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling       amusements  mrs  bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly       for lydia s interruption  and promised that it should not occur       again  if he would resume his book  but mr  collins  after       assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will  and       should never resent her behaviour as any affront  seated himself       at another table with mr  bennet  and prepared for backgammon              mr  collins was not a sensible man  and the deficiency of nature       had been but little assisted by education or society  the       greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of       an illiterate and miserly father  and though he belonged to one       of the universities  he had merely kept the necessary terms        without forming at it any useful acquaintance  the subjection in       which his father had brought him up had given him originally       great humility of manner  but it was now a good deal counteracted       by the self conceit of a weak head  living in retirement  and the       consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity  a       fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh       when the living of hunsford was vacant  and the respect which he       felt for her high rank  and his veneration for her as his       patroness  mingling with a very good opinion of himself  of his       authority as a clergyman  and his right as a rector  made him       altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness  self importance       and humility         having now a good house and a very sufficient income  he intended       to marry  and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn       family he had a wife in view  as he meant to choose one of the       daughters  if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were       represented by common report  this was his plan of amends of       atonement for inheriting their father s estate  and he thought it       an excellent one  full of eligibility and suitableness  and       excessively generous and disinterested on his own part         his plan did not vary on seeing them  miss bennet s lovely face       confirmed his views  and established all his strictest notions of       what was due to seniority  and for the first evening she was       his settled choice  the next morning  however  made an       alteration  for in a quarter of an hour s tête à tête with mrs        bennet before breakfast  a conversation beginning with his       parsonage house  and leading naturally to the avowal of his       hopes  that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn        produced from her  amid very complaisant smiles and general       encouragement  a caution against the very jane he had fixed on         as to her younger daughters  she could not take upon her to       say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any       prepossession  her eldest daughter  she must just mention she       felt it incumbent on her to hint  was likely to be very soon       engaged          mr  collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was       soon done done while mrs  bennet was stirring the fire        elizabeth  equally next to jane in birth and beauty  succeeded       her of course         mrs  bennet treasured up the hint  and trusted that she might       soon have two daughters married  and the man whom she could not       bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces         lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten  every       sister except mary agreed to go with her  and mr  collins was to       attend them  at the request of mr  bennet  who was most anxious       to get rid of him  and have his library to himself  for thither       mr  collins had followed him after breakfast  and there he would       continue  nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the       collection  but really talking to mr  bennet  with little       cessation  of his house and garden at hunsford  such doings       discomposed mr  bennet exceedingly  in his library he had been       always sure of leisure and tranquillity  and though prepared  as       he told elizabeth  to meet with folly and conceit in every other       room of the house  he was used to be free from them there  his       civility  therefore  was most prompt in inviting mr  collins to       join his daughters in their walk  and mr  collins  being in fact       much better fitted for a walker than a reader  was extremely       pleased to close his large book  and go         in pompous nothings on his side  and civil assents on that of his       cousins  their time passed till they entered meryton  the       attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by       him  their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in       quest of the officers  and nothing less than a very smart bonnet       indeed  or a really new muslin in a shop window  could recall       them         but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man        whom they had never seen before  of most gentlemanlike       appearance  walking with another officer on the other side of the       way  the officer was the very mr  denny concerning whose return       from london lydia came to enquire  and he bowed as they passed        all were struck with the stranger s air  all wondered who he       could be  and kitty and lydia  determined if possible to find       out  led the way across the street  under pretense of wanting       something in an opposite shop  and fortunately had just gained       the pavement when the two gentlemen  turning back  had reached       the same spot  mr  denny addressed them directly  and entreated       permission to introduce his friend  mr  wickham  who had returned       with him the day before from town  and he was happy to say had       accepted a commission in their corps  this was exactly as it       should be  for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him       completely charming  his appearance was greatly in his favour  he       had all the best part of beauty  a fine countenance  a good       figure  and very pleasing address  the introduction was followed       up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness       at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming  and the whole       party were still standing and talking together very agreeably        when the sound of horses drew their notice  and darcy and bingley       were seen riding down the street  on distinguishing the ladies of       the group  the two gentlemen came directly towards them  and       began the usual civilities  bingley was the principal spokesman        and miss bennet the principal object  he was then  he said  on       his way to longbourn on purpose to enquire after her  mr  darcy       corroborated it with a bow  and was beginning to determine not to       fix his eyes on elizabeth  when they were suddenly arrested by       the sight of the stranger  and elizabeth happening to see the       countenance of both as they looked at each other  was all       astonishment at the effect of the meeting  both changed colour        one looked white  the other red  mr  wickham  after a few       moments  touched his hat a salutation which mr  darcy just       deigned to return  what could be the meaning of it  it was       impossible to imagine  it was impossible not to long to know         in another minute  mr  bingley  but without seeming to have       noticed what passed  took leave and rode on with his friend         mr  denny and mr  wickham walked with the young ladies to the       door of mr  phillip s house  and then made their bows  in spite       of miss lydia s pressing entreaties that they should come in  and       even in spite of mrs  phillips s throwing up the parlour window       and loudly seconding the invitation         mrs  phillips was always glad to see her nieces  and the two       eldest  from their recent absence  were particularly welcome  and       she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return       home  which  as their own carriage had not fetched them  she       should have known nothing about  if she had not happened to see       mr  jones s shop boy in the street  who had told her that they       were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the       miss bennets were come away  when her civility was claimed       towards mr  collins by jane s introduction of him  she received       him with her very best politeness  which he returned with as much       more  apologising for his intrusion  without any previous       acquaintance with her  which he could not help flattering       himself  however  might be justified by his relationship to the       young ladies who introduced him to her notice  mrs  phillips was       quite awed by such an excess of good breeding  but her       contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by       exclamations and enquiries about the other  of whom  however  she       could only tell her nieces what they already knew  that mr  denny       had brought him from london  and that he was to have a       lieutenant s commission in the   shire  she had been watching him       the last hour  she said  as he walked up and down the street  and       had mr  wickham appeared  kitty and lydia would certainly have       continued the occupation  but unluckily no one passed windows now       except a few of the officers  who  in comparison with the       stranger  were become  stupid  disagreeable fellows   some of       them were to dine with the phillipses the next day  and their       aunt promised to make her husband call on mr  wickham  and give       him an invitation also  if the family from longbourn would come       in the evening  this was agreed to  and mrs  phillips protested       that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery       tickets  and a little bit of hot supper afterwards  the prospect       of such delights was very cheering  and they parted in mutual       good spirits  mr  collins repeated his apologies in quitting the       room  and was assured with unwearying civility that they were       perfectly needless         as they walked home  elizabeth related to jane what she had seen       pass between the two gentlemen  but though jane would have       defended either or both  had they appeared to be in the wrong        she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister         mr  collins on his return highly gratified mrs  bennet by       admiring mrs  phillips s manners and politeness  he protested       that  except lady catherine and her daughter  he had never seen a       more elegant woman  for she had not only received him with the       utmost civility  but even pointedly included him in her       invitation for the next evening  although utterly unknown to her       before  something  he supposed  might be attributed to his       connection with them  but yet he had never met with so much       attention in the whole course of his life              as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with       their aunt  and all mr  collins s scruples of leaving mr  and       mrs  bennet for a single evening during his visit were most       steadily resisted  the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at       a suitable hour to meryton  and the girls had the pleasure of       hearing  as they entered the drawing room  that mr  wickham had       accepted their uncle s invitation  and was then in the house         when this information was given  and they had all taken their       seats  mr  collins was at leisure to look around him and admire        and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the       apartment  that he declared he might almost have supposed himself       in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings  a comparison       that did not at first convey much gratification  but when mrs        phillips understood from him what rosings was  and who was its       proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one       of lady catherine s drawing rooms  and found that the       chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds  she felt all       the force of the compliment  and would hardly have resented a       comparison with the housekeeper s room         in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her       mansion  with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble       abode  and the improvements it was receiving  he was happily       employed until the gentlemen joined them  and he found in mrs        phillips a very attentive listener  whose opinion of his       consequence increased with what she heard  and who was resolving       to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could  to       the girls  who could not listen to their cousin  and who had       nothing to do but to wish for an instrument  and examine their       own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece  the       interval of waiting appeared very long  it was over at last        however  the gentlemen did approach  and when mr  wickham walked       into the room  elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing       him before  nor thinking of him since  with the smallest degree       of unreasonable admiration  the officers of the   shire were in       general a very creditable  gentlemanlike set  and the best of       them were of the present party  but mr  wickham was as far beyond       them all in person  countenance  air  and walk  as they were       superior to the broad faced  stuffy uncle phillips  breathing       port wine  who followed them into the room         mr  wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female       eye was turned  and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he       finally seated himself  and the agreeable manner in which he       immediately fell into conversation  though it was only on its       being a wet night  made her feel that the commonest  dullest        most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill       of the speaker         with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr  wickham and       the officers  mr  collins seemed to sink into insignificance  to       the young ladies he certainly was nothing  but he had still at       intervals a kind listener in mrs  phillips  and was by her       watchfulness  most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin        when the card tables were placed  he had the opportunity of       obliging her in turn  by sitting down to whist          i know little of the game at present   said he   but i shall be       glad to improve myself  for in my situation in life   mrs        phillips was very glad for his compliance  but could not wait for       his reason         mr  wickham did not play at whist  and with ready delight was he       received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia  at first       there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely  for she       was a most determined talker  but being likewise extremely fond       of lottery tickets  she soon grew too much interested in the       game  too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to       have attention for anyone in particular  allowing for the common       demands of the game  mr  wickham was therefore at leisure to talk       to elizabeth  and she was very willing to hear him  though what       she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the       history of his acquaintance with mr  darcy  she dared not even       mention that gentleman  her curiosity  however  was unexpectedly       relieved  mr  wickham began the subject himself  he enquired how       far netherfield was from meryton  and  after receiving her       answer  asked in a hesitating manner how long mr  darcy had been       staying there          about a month   said elizabeth  and then  unwilling to let the       subject drop  added   he is a man of very large property in       derbyshire  i understand           yes   replied mr  wickham   his estate there is a noble one  a       clear ten thousand per annum  you could not have met with a       person more capable of giving you certain information on that       head than myself  for i have been connected with his family in a       particular manner from my infancy          elizabeth could not but look surprised          you may well be surprised  miss bennet  at such an assertion        after seeing  as you probably might  the very cold manner of our       meeting yesterday  are you much acquainted with mr  darcy           as much as i ever wish to be   cried elizabeth very warmly   i       have spent four days in the same house with him  and i think him       very disagreeable           i have no right to give my opinion   said wickham   as to his       being agreeable or otherwise  i am not qualified to form one  i       have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge  it is       impossible for me to be impartial  but i believe your opinion       of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not       express it quite so strongly anywhere else  here you are in your       own family           upon my word  i say no more here than i might say in any house       in the neighbourhood  except netherfield  he is not at all liked       in hertfordshire  everybody is disgusted with his pride  you will       not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone           i cannot pretend to be sorry   said wickham  after a short       interruption   that he or that any man should not be estimated       beyond their deserts  but with him i believe it does not often       happen  the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence  or       frightened by his high and imposing manners  and sees him only as       he chooses to be seen           i should take him  even on my slight acquaintance  to be an       ill tempered man   wickham only shook his head          i wonder   said he  at the next opportunity of speaking         whether he is likely to be in this country much longer           i do not at all know  but i heard nothing of his going away       when i was at netherfield  i hope your plans in favour of the         shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood           oh  no it is not for me to be driven away by mr  darcy  if       he wishes to avoid seeing me  he must go  we are not on       friendly terms  and it always gives me pain to meet him  but i       have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim       before all the world  a sense of very great ill usage  and most       painful regrets at his being what he is  his father  miss bennet        the late mr  darcy  was one of the best men that ever breathed        and the truest friend i ever had  and i can never be in company       with this mr  darcy without being grieved to the soul by a       thousand tender recollections  his behaviour to myself has been       scandalous  but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and       everything  rather than his disappointing the hopes and       disgracing the memory of his father          elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase  and       listened with all her heart  but the delicacy of it prevented       further enquiry         mr  wickham began to speak on more general topics  meryton  the       neighbourhood  the society  appearing highly pleased with all       that he had yet seen  and speaking of the latter with gentle but       very intelligible gallantry          it was the prospect of constant society  and good society   he       added   which was my chief inducement to enter the   shire  i       knew it to be a most respectable  agreeable corps  and my friend       denny tempted me further by his account of their present       quarters  and the very great attentions and excellent       acquaintances meryton had procured them  society  i own  is       necessary to me  i have been a disappointed man  and my spirits       will not bear solitude  i must have employment and society  a       military life is not what i was intended for  but circumstances       have now made it eligible  the church ought to have been my       profession i was brought up for the church  and i should at this       time have been in possession of a most valuable living  had it       pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now           indeed           yes the late mr  darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of       the best living in his gift  he was my godfather  and excessively       attached to me  i cannot do justice to his kindness  he meant to       provide for me amply  and thought he had done it  but when the       living fell  it was given elsewhere           good heavens   cried elizabeth   but how could that be  how       could his will be disregarded  why did you not seek legal       redress           there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest       as to give me no hope from law  a man of honour could not have       doubted the intention  but mr  darcy chose to doubt it or to       treat it as a merely conditional recommendation  and to assert       that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance        imprudence in short anything or nothing  certain it is  that the       living became vacant two years ago  exactly as i was of an age to       hold it  and that it was given to another man  and no less       certain is it  that i cannot accuse myself of having really done       anything to deserve to lose it  i have a warm  unguarded temper        and i may have spoken my opinion of him  and to him  too       freely  i can recall nothing worse  but the fact is  that we are       very different sort of men  and that he hates me           this is quite shocking  he deserves to be publicly disgraced           some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me        till i can forget his father  i can never defy or expose him          elizabeth honoured him for such feelings  and thought him       handsomer than ever as he expressed them          but what   said she  after a pause   can have been his motive        what can have induced him to behave so cruelly           a thorough  determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot       but attribute in some measure to jealousy  had the late mr  darcy       liked me less  his son might have borne with me better  but his       father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him  i believe  very       early in life  he had not a temper to bear the sort of       competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was       often given me           i had not thought mr  darcy so bad as this though i have never       liked him  i had not thought so very ill of him  i had supposed       him to be despising his fellow creatures in general  but did not       suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge  such       injustice  such inhumanity as this          after a few minutes  reflection  however  she continued   i do       remember his boasting one day  at netherfield  of the       implacability of his resentments  of his having an unforgiving       temper  his disposition must be dreadful           i will not trust myself on the subject   replied wickham   i       can hardly be just to him          elizabeth was again deep in thought  and after a time exclaimed         to treat in such a manner the godson  the friend  the favourite       of his father   she could have added   a young man  too  like       you  whose very countenance may vouch for your being       amiable  but she contented herself with   and one  too  who had       probably been his companion from childhood  connected together        as i think you said  in the closest manner           we were born in the same parish  within the same park  the       greatest part of our youth was passed together  inmates of the       same house  sharing the same amusements  objects of the same       parental care  my father began life in the profession which       your uncle  mr  phillips  appears to do so much credit to but he       gave up everything to be of use to the late mr  darcy and devoted       all his time to the care of the pemberley property  he was most       highly esteemed by mr  darcy  a most intimate  confidential       friend  mr  darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the       greatest obligations to my father s active superintendence  and       when  immediately before my father s death  mr  darcy gave him a       voluntary promise of providing for me  i am convinced that he       felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him  as of his       affection to myself           how strange   cried elizabeth   how abominable  i wonder that       the very pride of this mr  darcy has not made him just to you  if       from no better motive  that he should not have been too proud to       be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it           it is wonderful   replied wickham   for almost all his actions       may be traced to pride  and pride had often been his best friend        it has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other       feeling  but we are none of us consistent  and in his behaviour       to me there were stronger impulses even than pride           can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good           yes  it has often led him to be liberal and generous  to give       his money freely  to display hospitality  to assist his tenants        and relieve the poor  family pride  and filial pride for he is       very proud of what his father was have done this  not to appear       to disgrace his family  to degenerate from the popular qualities        or lose the influence of the pemberley house  is a powerful       motive  he has also brotherly pride  which  with some       brotherly affection  makes him a very kind and careful guardian       of his sister  and you will hear him generally cried up as the       most attentive and best of brothers           what sort of girl is miss darcy          he shook his head   i wish i could call her amiable  it gives me       pain to speak ill of a darcy  but she is too much like her       brother very  very proud  as a child  she was affectionate and       pleasing  and extremely fond of me  and i have devoted hours and       hours to her amusement  but she is nothing to me now  she is a       handsome girl  about fifteen or sixteen  and  i understand        highly accomplished  since her father s death  her home has been       london  where a lady lives with her  and superintends her       education          after many pauses and many trials of other subjects  elizabeth       could not help reverting once more to the first  and saying          i am astonished at his intimacy with mr  bingley  how can mr        bingley  who seems good humour itself  and is  i really believe        truly amiable  be in friendship with such a man  how can they       suit each other  do you know mr  bingley           not at all           he is a sweet tempered  amiable  charming man  he cannot know       what mr  darcy is           probably not  but mr  darcy can please where he chooses  he does       not want abilities  he can be a conversible companion if he       thinks it worth his while  among those who are at all his equals       in consequence  he is a very different man from what he is to the       less prosperous  his pride never deserts him  but with the rich       he is liberal minded  just  sincere  rational  honourable  and       perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure          the whist party soon afterwards breaking up  the players gathered       round the other table and mr  collins took his station between       his cousin elizabeth and mrs  phillips  the usual enquiries as to       his success were made by the latter  it had not been very great        he had lost every point  but when mrs  phillips began to express       her concern thereupon  he assured her with much earnest gravity       that it was not of the least importance  that he considered the       money as a mere trifle  and begged that she would not make       herself uneasy          i know very well  madam   said he   that when persons sit down       to a card table  they must take their chances of these things        and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five       shillings any object  there are undoubtedly many who could not       say the same  but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh  i am       removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters          mr  wickham s attention was caught  and after observing mr        collins for a few moments  he asked elizabeth in a low voice       whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the       family of de bourgh          lady catherine de bourgh   she replied   has very lately given       him a living  i hardly know how mr  collins was first introduced       to her notice  but he certainly has not known her long           you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne       darcy were sisters  consequently that she is aunt to the present       mr  darcy           no  indeed  i did not  i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s       connections  i never heard of her existence till the day before       yesterday           her daughter  miss de bourgh  will have a very large fortune        and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two       estates          this information made elizabeth smile  as she thought of poor       miss bingley  vain indeed must be all her attentions  vain and       useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself        if he were already self destined for another          mr  collins   said she   speaks highly both of lady catherine       and her daughter  but from some particulars that he has related       of her ladyship  i suspect his gratitude misleads him  and that       in spite of her being his patroness  she is an arrogant        conceited woman           i believe her to be both in a great degree   replied wickham   i       have not seen her for many years  but i very well remember that i       never liked her  and that her manners were dictatorial and       insolent  she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and       clever  but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities       from her rank and fortune  part from her authoritative manner        and the rest from the pride of her nephew  who chooses that       everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the       first class          elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of       it  and they continued talking together  with mutual satisfaction       till supper put an end to cards  and gave the rest of the ladies       their share of mr  wickham s attentions  there could be no       conversation in the noise of mrs  phillips s supper party  but       his manners recommended him to everybody  whatever he said  was       said well  and whatever he did  done gracefully  elizabeth went       away with her head full of him  she could think of nothing but of       mr  wickham  and of what he had told her  all the way home  but       there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went        for neither lydia nor mr  collins were once silent  lydia talked       incessantly of lottery tickets  of the fish she had lost and the       fish she had won  and mr  collins in describing the civility of       mr  and mrs  phillips  protesting that he did not in the least       regard his losses at whist  enumerating all the dishes at supper        and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins  had more to       say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at       longbourn house              elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between       mr  wickham and herself  jane listened with astonishment and       concern  she knew not how to believe that mr  darcy could be so       unworthy of mr  bingley s regard  and yet  it was not in her       nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable       appearance as wickham  the possibility of his having endured such       unkindness  was enough to interest all her tender feelings  and       nothing remained therefore to be done  but to think well of them       both  to defend the conduct of each  and throw into the account       of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained          they have both   said she   been deceived  i dare say  in some       way or other  of which we can form no idea  interested people       have perhaps misrepresented each to the other  it is  in short        impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which       may have alienated them  without actual blame on either side           very true  indeed  and now  my dear jane  what have you got to       say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been       concerned in the business  do clear them too  or we shall be       obliged to think ill of somebody           laugh as much as you choose  but you will not laugh me out of my       opinion  my dearest lizzy  do but consider in what a disgraceful       light it places mr  darcy  to be treating his father s favourite       in such a manner  one whom his father had promised to provide       for  it is impossible  no man of common humanity  no man who had       any value for his character  could be capable of it  can his most       intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him  oh  no           i can much more easily believe mr  bingley s being imposed on        than that mr  wickham should invent such a history of himself as       he gave me last night  names  facts  everything mentioned without       ceremony  if it be not so  let mr  darcy contradict it  besides        there was truth in his looks           it is difficult indeed it is distressing  one does not know what       to think           i beg your pardon  one knows exactly what to think          but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr        bingley  if he had been imposed on  would have much to suffer       when the affair became public         the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery  where this       conversation passed  by the arrival of the very persons of whom       they had been speaking  mr  bingley and his sisters came to give       their personal invitation for the long expected ball at       netherfield  which was fixed for the following tuesday  the two       ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again  called it       an age since they had met  and repeatedly asked what she had been       doing with herself since their separation  to the rest of the       family they paid little attention  avoiding mrs  bennet as much       as possible  saying not much to elizabeth  and nothing at all to       the others  they were soon gone again  rising from their seats       with an activity which took their brother by surprise  and       hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs  bennet s civilities         the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to       every female of the family  mrs  bennet chose to consider it as       given in compliment to her eldest daughter  and was particularly       flattered by receiving the invitation from mr  bingley himself        instead of a ceremonious card  jane pictured to herself a happy       evening in the society of her two friends  and the attentions of       their brother  and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a       great deal with mr  wickham  and of seeing a confirmation of       everything in mr  darcy s look and behaviour  the happiness       anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single       event  or any particular person  for though they each  like       elizabeth  meant to dance half the evening with mr  wickham  he       was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them  and a       ball was  at any rate  a ball  and even mary could assure her       family that she had no disinclination for it          while i can have my mornings to myself   said she   it is       enough i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening       engagements  society has claims on us all  and i profess myself       one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement       as desirable for everybody          elizabeth s spirits were so high on this occasion  that though       she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr  collins  she could       not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr  bingley s       invitation  and if he did  whether he would think it proper to       join in the evening s amusement  and she was rather surprised to       find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head  and       was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop        or lady catherine de bourgh  by venturing to dance          i am by no means of the opinion  i assure you   said he   that a       ball of this kind  given by a young man of character  to       respectable people  can have any evil tendency  and i am so far       from objecting to dancing myself  that i shall hope to be       honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of       the evening  and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours        miss elizabeth  for the two first dances especially  a preference       which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause        and not to any disrespect for her          elizabeth felt herself completely taken in  she had fully       proposed being engaged by mr  wickham for those very dances  and       to have mr  collins instead  her liveliness had never been worse       timed  there was no help for it  however  mr  wickham s happiness       and her own were perforce delayed a little longer  and mr        collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could        she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea       it suggested of something more  it now first struck her  that       she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being       mistress of hunsford parsonage  and of assisting to form a       quadrille table at rosings  in the absence of more eligible       visitors  the idea soon reached to conviction  as she observed       his increasing civilities toward herself  and heard his frequent       attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity  and though more       astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms        it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the       probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her        elizabeth  however  did not choose to take the hint  being well       aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any       reply  mr  collins might never make the offer  and till he did        it was useless to quarrel about him         if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk       of  the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable       state at this time  for from the day of the invitation  to the       day of the ball  there was such a succession of rain as prevented       their walking to meryton once  no aunt  no officers  no news       could be sought after the very shoe roses for netherfield were       got by proxy  even elizabeth might have found some trial of her       patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of       her acquaintance with mr  wickham  and nothing less than a dance       on tuesday  could have made such a friday  saturday  sunday  and       monday endurable to kitty and lydia              till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield  and       looked in vain for mr  wickham among the cluster of red coats       there assembled  a doubt of his being present had never occurred       to her  the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any       of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed       her  she had dressed with more than usual care  and prepared in       the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained       unsubdued of his heart  trusting that it was not more than might       be won in the course of the evening  but in an instant arose the       dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr  darcy s       pleasure in the bingleys  invitation to the officers  and though       this was not exactly the case  the absolute fact of his absence       was pronounced by his friend denny  to whom lydia eagerly       applied  and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to       town on business the day before  and was not yet returned        adding  with a significant smile   i do not imagine his business       would have called him away just now  if he had not wanted to       avoid a certain gentleman here          this part of his intelligence  though unheard by lydia  was       caught by elizabeth  and  as it assured her that darcy was not       less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise       had been just  every feeling of displeasure against the former       was so sharpened by immediate disappointment  that she could       hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries       which he directly afterwards approached to make  attendance        forbearance  patience with darcy  was injury to wickham  she was       resolved against any sort of conversation with him  and turned       away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly       surmount even in speaking to mr  bingley  whose blind partiality       provoked her         but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour  and though every       prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening  it could not       dwell long on her spirits  and having told all her griefs to       charlotte lucas  whom she had not seen for a week  she was soon       able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her       cousin  and to point him out to her particular notice  the first       two dances  however  brought a return of distress  they were       dances of mortification  mr  collins  awkward and solemn        apologising instead of attending  and often moving wrong without       being aware of it  gave her all the shame and misery which a       disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give  the moment       of her release from him was ecstasy         she danced next with an officer  and had the refreshment of       talking of wickham  and of hearing that he was universally liked        when those dances were over  she returned to charlotte lucas  and       was in conversation with her  when she found herself suddenly       addressed by mr  darcy who took her so much by surprise in his       application for her hand  that  without knowing what she did  she       accepted him  he walked away again immediately  and she was left       to fret over her own want of presence of mind  charlotte tried to       console her          i dare say you will find him very agreeable           heaven forbid  that would be the greatest misfortune of all        to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate  do not       wish me such an evil          when the dancing recommenced  however  and darcy approached to       claim her hand  charlotte could not help cautioning her in a       whisper  not to be a simpleton  and allow her fancy for wickham       to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his       consequence  elizabeth made no answer  and took her place in the       set  amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being       allowed to stand opposite to mr  darcy  and reading in her       neighbours  looks  their equal amazement in beholding it  they       stood for some time without speaking a word  and she began to       imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances        and at first was resolved not to break it  till suddenly fancying       that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige       him to talk  she made some slight observation on the dance  he       replied  and was again silent  after a pause of some minutes  she       addressed him a second time with   it is your turn to say       something now  mr  darcy  i talked about the dance  and you       ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room  or the       number of couples          he smiled  and assured her that whatever she wished him to say       should be said          very well  that reply will do for the present  perhaps by and by       i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public       ones  but now we may be silent           do you talk by rule  then  while you are dancing           sometimes  one must speak a little  you know  it would look odd       to be entirely silent for half an hour together  and yet for the       advantage of some  conversation ought to be so arranged  as       that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible           are you consulting your own feelings in the present case  or do       you imagine that you are gratifying mine           both   replied elizabeth archly   for i have always seen a great       similarity in the turn of our minds  we are each of an unsocial        taciturn disposition  unwilling to speak  unless we expect to say       something that will amaze the whole room  and be handed down to       posterity with all the éclat of a proverb           this is no very striking resemblance of your own character  i am       sure   said he   how near it may be to mine  i cannot pretend       to say  you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly           i must not decide on my own performance          he made no answer  and they were again silent till they had gone       down the dance  when he asked her if she and her sisters did not       very often walk to meryton  she answered in the affirmative  and        unable to resist the temptation  added   when you met us there       the other day  we had just been forming a new acquaintance          the effect was immediate  a deeper shade of hauteur overspread       his features  but he said not a word  and elizabeth  though       blaming herself for her own weakness  could not go on  at length       darcy spoke  and in a constrained manner said   mr  wickham is       blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making       friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them  is       less certain           he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship   replied       elizabeth with emphasis   and in a manner which he is likely to       suffer from all his life          darcy made no answer  and seemed desirous of changing the       subject  at that moment  sir william lucas appeared close to       them  meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the       room  but on perceiving mr  darcy  he stopped with a bow of       superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his       partner          i have been most highly gratified indeed  my dear sir  such very       superior dancing is not often seen  it is evident that you belong       to the first circles  allow me to say  however  that your fair       partner does not disgrace you  and that i must hope to have this       pleasure often repeated  especially when a certain desirable       event  my dear eliza  glancing at her sister and bingley  shall       take place  what congratulations will then flow in  i appeal to       mr  darcy  but let me not interrupt you  sir  you will not thank       me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young       lady  whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me          the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy  but       sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him       forcibly  and his eyes were directed with a very serious       expression towards bingley and jane  who were dancing together        recovering himself  however  shortly  he turned to his partner        and said   sir william s interruption has made me forget what we       were talking of           i do not think we were speaking at all  sir william could not       have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for       themselves  we have tried two or three subjects already without       success  and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine           what think you of books   said he  smiling          books oh  no  i am sure we never read the same  or not with the       same feelings           i am sorry you think so  but if that be the case  there can at       least be no want of subject  we may compare our different       opinions           no i cannot talk of books in a ball room  my head is always full       of something else           the present always occupies you in such scenes does it   said       he  with a look of doubt          yes  always   she replied  without knowing what she said  for       her thoughts had wandered far from the subject  as soon       afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming   i remember       hearing you once say  mr  darcy  that you hardly ever forgave        that your resentment once created was unappeasable  you are very       cautious  i suppose  as to its being created           i am   said he  with a firm voice          and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice           i hope not           it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their       opinion  to be secure of judging properly at first           may i ask to what these questions tend           merely to the illustration of your character   said she        endeavouring to shake off her gravity   i am trying to make it       out           and what is your success          she shook her head   i do not get on at all  i hear such       different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly           i can readily believe   answered he gravely   that reports may       vary greatly with respect to me  and i could wish  miss bennet        that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment        as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no       credit on either           but if i do not take your likeness now  i may never have another       opportunity           i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours   he coldly       replied  she said no more  and they went down the other dance and       parted in silence  and on each side dissatisfied  though not to       an equal degree  for in darcy s breast there was a tolerably       powerful feeling towards her  which soon procured her pardon  and       directed all his anger against another         they had not long separated  when miss bingley came towards her        and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her          so  miss eliza  i hear you are quite delighted with george       wickham  your sister has been talking to me about him  and asking       me a thousand questions  and i find that the young man quite       forgot to tell you  among his other communication  that he was       the son of old wickham  the late mr  darcy s steward  let me       recommend you  however  as a friend  not to give implicit       confidence to all his assertions  for as to mr  darcy s using him       ill  it is perfectly false  for  on the contrary  he has always       been remarkably kind to him  though george wickham has treated       mr  darcy in a most infamous manner  i do not know the       particulars  but i know very well that mr  darcy is not in the       least to blame  that he cannot bear to hear george wickham       mentioned  and that though my brother thought that he could not       well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers  he       was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the       way  his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing        indeed  and i wonder how he could presume to do it  i pity you        miss eliza  for this discovery of your favourite s guilt  but       really  considering his descent  one could not expect much       better           his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the       same   said elizabeth angrily   for i have heard you accuse him       of nothing worse than of being the son of mr  darcy s steward        and of that  i can assure you  he informed me himself           i beg your pardon   replied miss bingley  turning away with a       sneer   excuse my interference it was kindly meant           insolent girl   said elizabeth to herself   you are much       mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as       this  i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the       malice of mr  darcy   she then sought her eldest sister  who had       undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of bingley  jane       met her with a smile of such sweet complacency  a glow of such       happy expression  as sufficiently marked how well she was       satisfied with the occurrences of the evening  elizabeth       instantly read her feelings  and at that moment solicitude for       wickham  resentment against his enemies  and everything else        gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for       happiness          i want to know   said she  with a countenance no less smiling       than her sister s   what you have learnt about mr  wickham  but       perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any       third person  in which case you may be sure of my pardon           no   replied jane   i have not forgotten him  but i have nothing       satisfactory to tell you  mr  bingley does not know the whole of       his history  and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which       have principally offended mr  darcy  but he will vouch for the       good conduct  the probity  and honour of his friend  and is       perfectly convinced that mr  wickham has deserved much less       attention from mr  darcy than he has received  and i am sorry to       say by his account as well as his sister s  mr  wickham is by no       means a respectable young man  i am afraid he has been very       imprudent  and has deserved to lose mr  darcy s regard           mr  bingley does not know mr  wickham himself           no  he never saw him till the other morning at meryton           this account then is what he has received from mr  darcy  i am       satisfied  but what does he say of the living           he does not exactly recollect the circumstances  though he has       heard them from mr  darcy more than once  but he believes that it       was left to him conditionally only           i have not a doubt of mr  bingley s sincerity   said elizabeth       warmly   but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances       only  mr  bingley s defense of his friend was a very able one  i       dare say  but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the       story  and has learnt the rest from that friend himself  i shall       venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before          she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each        and on which there could be no difference of sentiment  elizabeth       listened with delight to the happy  though modest hopes which       jane entertained of mr  bingley s regard  and said all in her       power to heighten her confidence in it  on their being joined by       mr  bingley himself  elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas  to whose       enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had       scarcely replied  before mr  collins came up to them  and told       her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as       to make a most important discovery          i have found out   said he   by a singular accident  that there       is now in the room a near relation of my patroness  i happened to       overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who       does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de       bourgh  and of her mother lady catherine  how wonderfully these       sort of things occur  who would have thought of my meeting with        perhaps  a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly  i       am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay       my respects to him  which i am now going to do  and trust he will       excuse my not having done it before  my total ignorance of the       connection must plead my apology           you are not going to introduce yourself to mr  darcy           indeed i am  i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it       earlier  i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew  it will       be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well       yesterday se nnight          elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme  assuring       him that mr  darcy would consider his addressing him without       introduction as an impertinent freedom  rather than a compliment       to his aunt  that it was not in the least necessary there should       be any notice on either side  and that if it were  it must belong       to mr  darcy  the superior in consequence  to begin the       acquaintance  mr  collins listened to her with the determined air       of following his own inclination  and  when she ceased speaking        replied thus          my dear miss elizabeth  i have the highest opinion in the world       in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of       your understanding  but permit me to say  that there must be a       wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst       the laity  and those which regulate the clergy  for  give me       leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in       point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided       that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time       maintained  you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of       my conscience on this occasion  which leads me to perform what i       look on as a point of duty  pardon me for neglecting to profit by       your advice  which on every other subject shall be my constant       guide  though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted       by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a       young lady like yourself   and with a low bow he left her to       attack mr  darcy  whose reception of his advances she eagerly       watched  and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very       evident  her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and       though she could not hear a word of it  she felt as if hearing it       all  and saw in the motion of his lips the words  apology          hunsford   and  lady catherine de bourgh   it vexed her to see       him expose himself to such a man  mr  darcy was eyeing him with       unrestrained wonder  and when at last mr  collins allowed him       time to speak  replied with an air of distant civility  mr        collins  however  was not discouraged from speaking again  and       mr  darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length       of his second speech  and at the end of it he only made him a       slight bow  and moved another way  mr  collins then returned to       elizabeth          i have no reason  i assure you   said he   to be dissatisfied       with my reception  mr  darcy seemed much pleased with the       attention  he answered me with the utmost civility  and even paid       me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady       catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a       favour unworthily  it was really a very handsome thought  upon       the whole  i am much pleased with him          as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue  she       turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr        bingley  and the train of agreeable reflections which her       observations gave birth to  made her perhaps almost as happy as       jane  she saw her in idea settled in that very house  in all the       felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow  and she       felt capable  under such circumstances  of endeavouring even to       like bingley s two sisters  her mother s thoughts she plainly saw       were bent the same way  and she determined not to venture near       her  lest she might hear too much  when they sat down to supper        therefore  she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which       placed them within one of each other  and deeply was she vexed to       find that her mother was talking to that one person  lady lucas        freely  openly  and of nothing else but her expectation that jane       would soon be married to mr  bingley  it was an animating       subject  and mrs  bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while       enumerating the advantages of the match  his being such a       charming young man  and so rich  and living but three miles from       them  were the first points of self gratulation  and then it was       such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane        and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as       she could do  it was  moreover  such a promising thing for her       younger daughters  as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them       in the way of other rich men  and lastly  it was so pleasant at       her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to       the care of their sister  that she might not be obliged to go       into company more than she liked  it was necessary to make this       circumstance a matter of pleasure  because on such occasions it       is the etiquette  but no one was less likely than mrs  bennet to       find comfort in staying home at any period of her life  she       concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be       equally fortunate  though evidently and triumphantly believing       there was no chance of it         in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her       mother s words  or persuade her to describe her felicity in a       less audible whisper  for  to her inexpressible vexation  she       could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr  darcy        who sat opposite to them  her mother only scolded her for being       nonsensical          what is mr  darcy to me  pray  that i should be afraid of him  i       am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged       to say nothing he may not like to hear           for heaven s sake  madam  speak lower  what advantage can it be       for you to offend mr  darcy  you will never recommend yourself to       his friend by so doing          nothing that she could say  however  had any influence  her       mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone        elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation  she       could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr  darcy  though       every glance convinced her of what she dreaded  for though he was       not always looking at her mother  she was convinced that his       attention was invariably fixed by her  the expression of his face       changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and       steady gravity         at length  however  mrs  bennet had no more to say  and lady       lucas  who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights       which she saw no likelihood of sharing  was left to the comforts       of cold ham and chicken  elizabeth now began to revive  but not       long was the interval of tranquillity  for  when supper was over        singing was talked of  and she had the mortification of seeing       mary  after very little entreaty  preparing to oblige the       company  by many significant looks and silent entreaties  did she       endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance  but in vain        mary would not understand them  such an opportunity of exhibiting       was delightful to her  and she began her song  elizabeth s eyes       were fixed on her with most painful sensations  and she watched       her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which       was very ill rewarded at their close  for mary  on receiving        amongst the thanks of the table  the hint of a hope that she       might be prevailed on to favour them again  after the pause of       half a minute began another  mary s powers were by no means       fitted for such a display  her voice was weak  and her manner       affected  elizabeth was in agonies  she looked at jane  to see       how she bore it  but jane was very composedly talking to bingley        she looked at his two sisters  and saw them making signs of       derision at each other  and at darcy  who continued  however        imperturbably grave  she looked at her father to entreat his       interference  lest mary should be singing all night  he took the       hint  and when mary had finished her second song  said aloud         that will do extremely well  child  you have delighted us long       enough  let the other young ladies have time to exhibit          mary  though pretending not to hear  was somewhat disconcerted        and elizabeth  sorry for her  and sorry for her father s speech        was afraid her anxiety had done no good  others of the party were       now applied to          if i   said mr  collins   were so fortunate as to be able to       sing  i should have great pleasure  i am sure  in obliging the       company with an air  for i consider music as a very innocent       diversion  and perfectly compatible with the profession of a       clergyman  i do not mean  however  to assert that we can be       justified in devoting too much of our time to music  for there       are certainly other things to be attended to  the rector of a       parish has much to do  in the first place  he must make such an       agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not       offensive to his patron  he must write his own sermons  and the       time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties  and       the care and improvement of his dwelling  which he cannot be       excused from making as comfortable as possible  and i do not       think it of light importance that he should have attentive and       conciliatory manners towards everybody  especially towards those       to whom he owes his preferment  i cannot acquit him of that duty        nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of       testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the       family   and with a bow to mr  darcy  he concluded his speech        which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room        many stared many smiled  but no one looked more amused than mr        bennet himself  while his wife seriously commended mr  collins       for having spoken so sensibly  and observed in a half whisper to       lady lucas  that he was a remarkably clever  good kind of young       man         to elizabeth it appeared that  had her family made an agreement       to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening  it       would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more       spirit or finer success  and happy did she think it for bingley       and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his       notice  and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much       distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed  that his       two sisters and mr  darcy  however  should have such an       opportunity of ridiculing her relations  was bad enough  and she       could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman        or the insolent smiles of the ladies  were more intolerable         the rest of the evening brought her little amusement  she was       teased by mr  collins  who continued most perseveringly by her       side  and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him       again  put it out of her power to dance with others  in vain did       she entreat him to stand up with somebody else  and offer to       introduce him to any young lady in the room  he assured her  that       as to dancing  he was perfectly indifferent to it  that his chief       object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and       that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her       the whole evening  there was no arguing upon such a project  she       owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas  who often       joined them  and good naturedly engaged mr  collins s       conversation to herself         she was at least free from the offense of mr  darcy s further       notice  though often standing within a very short distance of       her  quite disengaged  he never came near enough to speak  she       felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr        wickham  and rejoiced in it         the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart        and  by a manoeuvre of mrs  bennet  had to wait for their       carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone        which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by       some of the family  mrs  hurst and her sister scarcely opened       their mouths  except to complain of fatigue  and were evidently       impatient to have the house to themselves  they repulsed every       attempt of mrs  bennet at conversation  and by so doing threw a       languor over the whole party  which was very little relieved by       the long speeches of mr  collins  who was complimenting mr        bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment        and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their       behaviour to their guests  darcy said nothing at all  mr  bennet        in equal silence  was enjoying the scene  mr  bingley and jane       were standing together  a little detached from the rest  and       talked only to each other  elizabeth preserved as steady a       silence as either mrs  hurst or miss bingley  and even lydia was       too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation       of  lord  how tired i am   accompanied by a violent yawn         when at length they arose to take leave  mrs  bennet was most       pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at       longbourn  and addressed herself especially to mr  bingley  to       assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner       with them at any time  without the ceremony of a formal       invitation  bingley was all grateful pleasure  and he readily       engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her        after his return from london  whither he was obliged to go the       next day for a short time         mrs  bennet was perfectly satisfied  and quitted the house under       the delightful persuasion that  allowing for the necessary       preparations of settlements  new carriages  and wedding clothes        she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in       the course of three or four months  of having another daughter       married to mr  collins  she thought with equal certainty  and       with considerable  though not equal  pleasure  elizabeth was the       least dear to her of all her children  and though the man and the       match were quite good enough for her  the worth of each was       eclipsed by mr  bingley and netherfield              the next day opened a new scene at longbourn  mr  collins made       his declaration in form  having resolved to do it without loss of       time  as his leave of absence extended only to the following       saturday  and having no feelings of diffidence to make it       distressing to himself even at the moment  he set about it in a       very orderly manner  with all the observances  which he supposed       a regular part of the business  on finding mrs  bennet        elizabeth  and one of the younger girls together  soon after       breakfast  he addressed the mother in these words          may i hope  madam  for your interest with your fair daughter       elizabeth  when i solicit for the honour of a private audience       with her in the course of this morning          before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise        mrs  bennet answered instantly   oh dear  yes certainly  i am       sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no       objection  come  kitty  i want you up stairs   and  gathering her       work together  she was hastening away  when elizabeth called out          dear madam  do not go  i beg you will not go  mr  collins must       excuse me  he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not       hear  i am going away myself           no  no  nonsense  lizzy  i desire you to stay where you are         and upon elizabeth s seeming really  with vexed and embarrassed       looks  about to escape  she added   lizzy  i insist upon your       staying and hearing mr  collins          elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s       consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to       get it over as soon and as quietly as possible  she sat down       again and tried to conceal  by incessant employment the feelings       which were divided between distress and diversion  mrs  bennet       and kitty walked off  and as soon as they were gone  mr  collins       began          believe me  my dear miss elizabeth  that your modesty  so far       from doing you any disservice  rather adds to your other       perfections  you would have been less amiable in my eyes had       there not been this little unwillingness  but allow me to       assure you  that i have your respected mother s permission for       this address  you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse        however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble  my       attentions have been too marked to be mistaken  almost as soon as       i entered the house  i singled you out as the companion of my       future life  but before i am run away with by my feelings on this       subject  perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons       for marrying and  moreover  for coming into hertfordshire with       the design of selecting a wife  as i certainly did          the idea of mr  collins  with all his solemn composure  being run       away with by his feelings  made elizabeth so near laughing  that       she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to       stop him further  and he continued          my reasons for marrying are  first  that i think it a right       thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances  like myself  to       set the example of matrimony in his parish  secondly  that i am       convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness  and       thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier  that it       is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble       lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness  twice has she       condescended to give me her opinion  unasked too   on this       subject  and it was but the very saturday night before i left       hunsford between our pools at quadrille  while mrs  jenkinson was       arranging miss de bourgh s footstool  that she said   mr        collins  you must marry  a clergyman like you must marry  choose       properly  choose a gentlewoman for my sake  and for your own        let her be an active  useful sort of person  not brought up high        but able to make a small income go a good way  this is my advice        find such a woman as soon as you can  bring her to hunsford  and       i will visit her   allow me  by the way  to observe  my fair       cousin  that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady       catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my       power to offer  you will find her manners beyond anything i can       describe  and your wit and vivacity  i think  must be acceptable       to her  especially when tempered with the silence and respect       which her rank will inevitably excite  thus much for my general       intention in favour of matrimony  it remains to be told why my       views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own       neighbourhood  where i can assure you there are many amiable       young women  but the fact is  that being  as i am  to inherit       this estate after the death of your honoured father  who        however  may live many years longer   i could not satisfy myself       without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters  that       the loss to them might be as little as possible  when the       melancholy event takes place which  however  as i have already       said  may not be for several years  this has been my motive  my       fair cousin  and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your       esteem  and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection  to       fortune i am perfectly indifferent  and shall make no demand of       that nature on your father  since i am well aware that it could       not be complied with  and that one thousand pounds in the four       per cents  which will not be yours till after your mother s       decease  is all that you may ever be entitled to  on that head        therefore  i shall be uniformly silent  and you may assure       yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when       we are married          it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now          you are too hasty  sir   she cried   you forget that i have made       no answer  let me do it without further loss of time  accept my       thanks for the compliment you are paying me  i am very sensible       of the honour of your proposals  but it is impossible for me to       do otherwise than to decline them           i am not now to learn   replied mr  collins  with a formal wave       of the hand   that it is usual with young ladies to reject the       addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept  when he       first applies for their favour  and that sometimes the refusal is       repeated a second  or even a third time  i am therefore by no       means discouraged by what you have just said  and shall hope to       lead you to the altar ere long           upon my word  sir   cried elizabeth   your hope is a rather       extraordinary one after my declaration  i do assure you that i am       not one of those young ladies  if such young ladies there are        who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of       being asked a second time  i am perfectly serious in my refusal        you could not make me happy  and i am convinced that i am the       last woman in the world who could make you so  nay  were your       friend lady catherine to know me  i am persuaded she would find       me in every respect ill qualified for the situation           were it certain that lady catherine would think so   said mr        collins very gravely  but i cannot imagine that her ladyship       would at all disapprove of you  and you may be certain when i       have the honour of seeing her again  i shall speak in the very       highest terms of your modesty  economy  and other amiable       qualification           indeed  mr  collins  all praise of me will be unnecessary  you       must give me leave to judge for myself  and pay me the compliment       of believing what i say  i wish you very happy and very rich  and       by refusing your hand  do all in my power to prevent your being       otherwise  in making me the offer  you must have satisfied the       delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family  and may take       possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls  without any       self reproach  this matter may be considered  therefore  as       finally settled   and rising as she thus spoke  she would have       quitted the room  had mr  collins not thus addressed her          when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the       subject  i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than       you have now given me  though i am far from accusing you of       cruelty at present  because i know it to be the established       custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application  and       perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as       would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female       character           really  mr  collins   cried elizabeth with some warmth   you       puzzle me exceedingly  if what i have hitherto said can appear to       you in the form of encouragement  i know not how to express my       refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one           you must give me leave to flatter myself  my dear cousin  that       your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course  my       reasons for believing it are briefly these  it does not appear to       me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance  or that the       establishment i can offer would be any other than highly       desirable  my situation in life  my connections with the family       of de bourgh  and my relationship to your own  are circumstances       highly in my favour  and you should take it into further       consideration  that in spite of your manifold attractions  it is       by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be       made you  your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all       likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable       qualifications  as i must therefore conclude that you are not       serious in your rejection of me  i shall choose to attribute it       to your wish of increasing my love by suspense  according to the       usual practice of elegant females           i do assure you  sir  that i have no pretensions whatever to       that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable       man  i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed       sincere  i thank you again and again for the honour you have done       me in your proposals  but to accept them is absolutely       impossible  my feelings in every respect forbid it  can i speak       plainer  do not consider me now as an elegant female  intending       to plague you  but as a rational creature  speaking the truth       from her heart           you are uniformly charming   cried he  with an air of awkward       gallantry   and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the       express authority of both your excellent parents  my proposals       will not fail of being acceptable          to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would       make no reply  and immediately and in silence withdrew        determined  if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals       as flattering encouragement  to apply to her father  whose       negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive  and       whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the       affectation and coquetry of an elegant female              mr  collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his       successful love  for mrs  bennet  having dawdled about in the       vestibule to watch for the end of the conference  no sooner saw       elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the       staircase  than she entered the breakfast room  and congratulated       both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their       nearer connection  mr  collins received and returned these       felicitations with equal pleasure  and then proceeded to relate       the particulars of their interview  with the result of which he       trusted he had every reason to be satisfied  since the refusal       which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow       from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her       character         this information  however  startled mrs  bennet  she would have       been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to       encourage him by protesting against his proposals  but she dared       not believe it  and could not help saying so          but  depend upon it  mr  collins   she added   that lizzy shall       be brought to reason  i will speak to her about it directly  she       is a very headstrong  foolish girl  and does not know her own       interest but i will make her know it           pardon me for interrupting you  madam   cried mr  collins   but       if she is really headstrong and foolish  i know not whether she       would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my       situation  who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage       state  if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit        perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me        because if liable to such defects of temper  she could not       contribute much to my felicity           sir  you quite misunderstand me   said mrs  bennet  alarmed         lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these  in everything       else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived  i will go       directly to mr  bennet  and we shall very soon settle it with       her  i am sure          she would not give him time to reply  but hurrying instantly to       her husband  called out as she entered the library   oh  mr        bennet  you are wanted immediately  we are all in an uproar  you       must come and make lizzy marry mr  collins  for she vows she will       not have him  and if you do not make haste he will change his       mind and not have her          mr  bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered  and       fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the       least altered by her communication          i have not the pleasure of understanding you   said he  when she       had finished her speech   of what are you talking           of mr  collins and lizzy  lizzy declares she will not have mr        collins  and mr  collins begins to say that he will not have       lizzy           and what am i to do on the occasion  it seems an hopeless       business           speak to lizzy about it yourself  tell her that you insist upon       her marrying him           let her be called down  she shall hear my opinion          mrs  bennet rang the bell  and miss elizabeth was summoned to the       library          come here  child   cried her father as she appeared   i have       sent for you on an affair of importance  i understand that mr        collins has made you an offer of marriage  is it true   elizabeth       replied that it was   very well and this offer of marriage you       have refused           i have  sir           very well  we now come to the point  your mother insists upon       your accepting it  is it not so  mrs  bennet           yes  or i will never see her again           an unhappy alternative is before you  elizabeth  from this day       you must be a stranger to one of your parents  your mother will       never see you again if you do not marry mr  collins  and i will       never see you again if you do          elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a       beginning  but mrs  bennet  who had persuaded herself that her       husband regarded the affair as she wished  was excessively       disappointed          what do you mean  mr  bennet  in talking this way  you promised       me to insist upon her marrying him           my dear   replied her husband   i have two small favours to       request  first  that you will allow me the free use of my       understanding on the present occasion  and secondly  of my room        i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be          not yet  however  in spite of her disappointment in her husband        did mrs  bennet give up the point  she talked to elizabeth again       and again  coaxed and threatened her by turns  she endeavoured to       secure jane in her interest  but jane  with all possible       mildness  declined interfering  and elizabeth  sometimes with       real earnestness  and sometimes with playful gaiety  replied to       her attacks  though her manner varied  however  her determination       never did         mr  collins  meanwhile  was meditating in solitude on what had       passed  he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what       motives his cousin could refuse him  and though his pride was       hurt  he suffered in no other way  his regard for her was quite       imaginary  and the possibility of her deserving her mother s       reproach prevented his feeling any regret         while the family were in this confusion  charlotte lucas came to       spend the day with them  she was met in the vestibule by lydia        who  flying to her  cried in a half whisper   i am glad you are       come  for there is such fun here  what do you think has happened       this morning  mr  collins has made an offer to lizzy  and she       will not have him          charlotte hardly had time to answer  before they were joined by       kitty  who came to tell the same news  and no sooner had they       entered the breakfast room  where mrs  bennet was alone  than she       likewise began on the subject  calling on miss lucas for her       compassion  and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to       comply with the wishes of all her family   pray do  my dear miss       lucas   she added in a melancholy tone   for nobody is on my       side  nobody takes part with me  i am cruelly used  nobody feels       for my poor nerves          charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and       elizabeth          aye  there she comes   continued mrs  bennet   looking as       unconcerned as may be  and caring no more for us than if we were       at york  provided she can have her own way  but i tell you  miss       lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer       of marriage in this way  you will never get a husband at all and       i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father       is dead  i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you  i       have done with you from this very day  i told you in the library        you know  that i should never speak to you again  and you will       find me as good as my word  i have no pleasure in talking to       undutiful children  not that i have much pleasure  indeed  in       talking to anybody  people who suffer as i do from nervous       complaints can have no great inclination for talking  nobody can       tell what i suffer  but it is always so  those who do not       complain are never pitied          her daughters listened in silence to this effusion  sensible that       any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase       the irritation  she talked on  therefore  without interruption       from any of them  till they were joined by mr  collins  who       entered the room with an air more stately than usual  and on       perceiving whom  she said to the girls   now  i do insist upon       it  that you  all of you  hold your tongues  and let me and mr        collins have a little conversation together          elizabeth passed quietly out of the room  jane and kitty       followed  but lydia stood her ground  determined to hear all she       could  and charlotte  detained first by the civility of mr        collins  whose enquiries after herself and all her family were       very minute  and then by a little curiosity  satisfied herself       with walking to the window and pretending not to hear  in a       doleful voice mrs  bennet began the projected conversation   oh        mr  collins           my dear madam   replied he   let us be for ever silent on this       point  far be it from me   he presently continued  in a voice       that marked his displeasure   to resent the behaviour of your       daughter  resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all        the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i       have been in early preferment  and i trust i am resigned  perhaps       not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had       my fair cousin honoured me with her hand  for i have often       observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the       blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our       estimation  you will not  i hope  consider me as showing any       disrespect to your family  my dear madam  by thus withdrawing my       pretensions to your daughter s favour  without having paid       yourself and mr  bennet the compliment of requesting you to       interpose your authority in my behalf  my conduct may  i fear  be       objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your       daughter s lips instead of your own  but we are all liable to       error  i have certainly meant well through the whole affair  my       object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself  with       due consideration for the advantage of all your family  and if my       manner has been at all reprehensible  i here beg leave to       apologise               the discussion of mr  collins s offer was now nearly at an end        and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings       necessarily attending it  and occasionally from some peevish       allusions of her mother  as for the gentleman himself  his       feelings were chiefly expressed  not by embarrassment or       dejection  or by trying to avoid her  but by stiffness of manner       and resentful silence  he scarcely ever spoke to her  and the       assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself       were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas  whose       civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all        and especially to her friend         the morrow produced no abatement of mrs  bennet s ill humour or       ill health  mr  collins was also in the same state of angry       pride  elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his       visit  but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it        he was always to have gone on saturday  and to saturday he meant       to stay         after breakfast  the girls walked to meryton to enquire if mr        wickham were returned  and to lament over his absence from the       netherfield ball  he joined them on their entering the town  and       attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation  and       the concern of everybody  was well talked over  to elizabeth        however  he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his       absence had been self imposed          i found   said he   as the time drew near that i had better not       meet mr  darcy  that to be in the same room  the same party with       him for so many hours together  might be more than i could bear        and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself          she highly approved his forbearance  and they had leisure for a       full discussion of it  and for all the commendation which they       civilly bestowed on each other  as wickham and another officer       walked back with them to longbourn  and during the walk he       particularly attended to her  his accompanying them was a double       advantage  she felt all the compliment it offered to herself  and       it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her       father and mother         soon after their return  a letter was delivered to miss bennet        it came from netherfield  the envelope contained a sheet of       elegant  little  hot pressed paper  well covered with a lady s       fair  flowing hand  and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance       change as she read it  and saw her dwelling intently on some       particular passages  jane recollected herself soon  and putting       the letter away  tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the       general conversation  but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the       subject which drew off her attention even from wickham  and no       sooner had he and his companion taken leave  than a glance from       jane invited her to follow her up stairs  when they had gained       their own room  jane  taking out the letter  said          this is from caroline bingley  what it contains has surprised me       a good deal  the whole party have left netherfield by this time        and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming       back again  you shall hear what she says          she then read the first sentence aloud  which comprised the       information of their having just resolved to follow their brother       to town directly  and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor       street  where mr  hurst had a house  the next was in these words         i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in       hertfordshire  except your society  my dearest friend  but we       will hope  at some future period  to enjoy many returns of that       delightful intercourse we have known  and in the meanwhile may       lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most       unreserved correspondence  i depend on you for that   to these       highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the       insensibility of distrust  and though the suddenness of their       removal surprised her  she saw nothing in it really to lament  it       was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would       prevent mr  bingley s being there  and as to the loss of their       society  she was persuaded that jane must cease to regard it  in       the enjoyment of his          it is unlucky   said she  after a short pause   that you should       not be able to see your friends before they leave the country        but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which       miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware        and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends       will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters  mr        bingley will not be detained in london by them           caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into       hertfordshire this winter  i will read it to you           when my brother left us yesterday  he imagined that the business       which took him to london might be concluded in three or four       days  but as we are certain it cannot be so  and at the same time       convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry       to leave it again  we have determined on following him thither        that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a       comfortless hotel  many of my acquaintances are already there for       the winter  i wish that i could hear that you  my dearest friend        had any intention of making one of the crowd but of that i       despair  i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may       abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings  and       that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling       the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you           it is evident by this   added jane   that he comes back no more       this winter           it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he       should           why will you think so  it must be his own doing  he is his own       master  but you do not know all  i will read you the passage       which particularly hurts me  i will have no reserves from you           mr  darcy is impatient to see his sister  and  to confess the       truth  we are scarcely less eager to meet her again  i really       do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty  elegance        and accomplishments  and the affection she inspires in louisa and       myself is heightened into something still more interesting  from       the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister  i       do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on       this subject  but i will not leave the country without confiding       them  and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable  my       brother admires her greatly already  he will have frequent       opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing  her       relations all wish the connection as much as his own  and a       sister s partiality is not misleading me  i think  when i call       charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart  with all       these circumstances to favour an attachment  and nothing to       prevent it  am i wrong  my dearest jane  in indulging the hope of       an event which will secure the happiness of so many           what do you think of this sentence  my dear lizzy   said jane       as she finished it   is it not clear enough  does it not       expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to       be her sister  that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s       indifference  and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings       for him  she means  most kindly   to put me on my guard  can       there be any other opinion on the subject           yes  there can  for mine is totally different  will you hear       it           most willingly           you shall have it in a few words  miss bingley sees that her       brother is in love with you  and wants him to marry miss darcy        she follows him to town in hope of keeping him there  and tries       to persuade you that he does not care about you          jane shook her head          indeed  jane  you ought to believe me  no one who has ever seen       you together can doubt his affection  miss bingley  i am sure        cannot  she is not such a simpleton  could she have seen half as       much love in mr  darcy for herself  she would have ordered her       wedding clothes  but the case is this  we are not rich enough or       grand enough for them  and she is the more anxious to get miss       darcy for her brother  from the notion that when there has been       one intermarriage  she may have less trouble in achieving a       second  in which there is certainly some ingenuity  and i dare       say it would succeed  if miss de bourgh were out of the way  but        my dearest jane  you cannot seriously imagine that because miss       bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy  he is       in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he       took leave of you on tuesday  or that it will be in her power to       persuade him that  instead of being in love with you  he is very       much in love with her friend           if we thought alike of miss bingley   replied jane   your       representation of all this might make me quite easy  but i know       the foundation is unjust  caroline is incapable of wilfully       deceiving anyone  and all that i can hope in this case is that       she is deceiving herself           that is right  you could not have started a more happy idea        since you will not take comfort in mine  believe her to be       deceived  by all means  you have now done your duty by her  and       must fret no longer           but  my dear sister  can i be happy  even supposing the best  in       accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to       marry elsewhere           you must decide for yourself   said elizabeth   and if  upon       mature deliberation  you find that the misery of disobliging his       two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his       wife  i advise you by all means to refuse him           how can you talk so   said jane  faintly smiling   you must know       that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their       disapprobation  i could not hesitate           i did not think you would  and that being the case  i cannot       consider your situation with much compassion           but if he returns no more this winter  my choice will never be       required  a thousand things may arise in six months          the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the       utmost contempt  it appeared to her merely the suggestion of       caroline s interested wishes  and she could not for a moment       suppose that those wishes  however openly or artfully spoken        could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone         she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she       felt on the subject  and had soon the pleasure of seeing its       happy effect  jane s temper was not desponding  and she was       gradually led to hope  though the diffidence of affection       sometimes overcame the hope  that bingley would return to       netherfield and answer every wish of her heart         they agreed that mrs  bennet should only hear of the departure of       the family  without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s       conduct  but even this partial communication gave her a great       deal of concern  and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that       the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting       so intimate together  after lamenting it  however  at some       length  she had the consolation that mr  bingley would be soon       down again and soon dining at longbourn  and the conclusion of       all was the comfortable declaration  that though he had been       invited only to a family dinner  she would take care to have two       full courses              the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again       during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen       to mr  collins  elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her         it keeps him in good humour   said she   and i am more obliged       to you than i can express   charlotte assured her friend of her       satisfaction in being useful  and that it amply repaid her for       the little sacrifice of her time  this was very amiable  but       charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any       conception of  its object was nothing else than to secure her       from any return of mr  collins s addresses  by engaging them       towards herself  such was miss lucas s scheme  and appearances       were so favourable  that when they parted at night  she would       have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave       hertfordshire so very soon  but here she did injustice to the       fire and independence of his character  for it led him to escape       out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness        and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet  he was       anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins  from a conviction       that if they saw him depart  they could not fail to conjecture       his design  and he was not willing to have the attempt known till       its success might be known likewise  for though feeling almost       secure  and with reason  for charlotte had been tolerably       encouraging  he was comparatively diffident since the adventure       of wednesday  his reception  however  was of the most flattering       kind  miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked       towards the house  and instantly set out to meet him accidentally       in the lane  but little had she dared to hope that so much love       and eloquence awaited her there         in as short a time as mr  collins s long speeches would allow        everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both        and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name       the day that was to make him the happiest of men  and though such       a solicitation must be waived for the present  the lady felt no       inclination to trifle with his happiness  the stupidity with       which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any       charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance  and miss       lucas  who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested       desire of an establishment  cared not how soon that establishment       were gained         sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their       consent  and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity  mr        collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for       their daughter  to whom they could give little fortune  and his       prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair  lady lucas       began directly to calculate  with more interest than the matter       had ever excited before  how many years longer mr  bennet was       likely to live  and sir william gave it as his decided opinion        that whenever mr  collins should be in possession of the       longbourn estate  it would be highly expedient that both he and       his wife should make their appearance at st  james s  the whole       family  in short  were properly overjoyed on the occasion  the       younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner       than they might otherwise have done  and the boys were relieved       from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid        charlotte herself was tolerably composed  she had gained her       point  and had time to consider of it  her reflections were in       general satisfactory  mr  collins  to be sure  was neither       sensible nor agreeable  his society was irksome  and his       attachment to her must be imaginary  but still he would be her       husband  without thinking highly either of men or matrimony        marriage had always been her object  it was the only provision       for well educated young women of small fortune  and however       uncertain of giving happiness  must be their pleasantest       preservative from want  this preservative she had now obtained        and at the age of twenty seven  without having ever been       handsome  she felt all the good luck of it  the least agreeable       circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to       elizabeth bennet  whose friendship she valued beyond that of any       other person  elizabeth would wonder  and probably would blame       her  and though her resolution was not to be shaken  her feelings       must be hurt by such a disapprobation  she resolved to give her       the information herself  and therefore charged mr  collins  when       he returned to longbourn to dinner  to drop no hint of what had       passed before any of the family  a promise of secrecy was of       course very dutifully given  but it could not be kept without       difficulty  for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst       forth in such very direct questions on his return as required       some ingenuity to evade  and he was at the same time exercising       great self denial  for he was longing to publish his prosperous       love         as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any       of the family  the ceremony of leave taking was performed when       the ladies moved for the night  and mrs  bennet  with great       politeness and cordiality  said how happy they should be to see       him at longbourn again  whenever his engagements might allow him       to visit them          my dear madam   he replied   this invitation is particularly       gratifying  because it is what i have been hoping to receive  and       you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon       as possible          they were all astonished  and mr  bennet  who could by no means       wish for so speedy a return  immediately said          but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here        my good sir  you had better neglect your relations than run the       risk of offending your patroness           my dear sir   replied mr  collins   i am particularly obliged to       you for this friendly caution  and you may depend upon my not       taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence           you cannot be too much upon your guard  risk anything rather       than her displeasure  and if you find it likely to be raised by       your coming to us again  which i should think exceedingly       probable  stay quietly at home  and be satisfied that we shall       take no offence           believe me  my dear sir  my gratitude is warmly excited by such       affectionate attention  and depend upon it  you will speedily       receive from me a letter of thanks for this  and for every other       mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire  as for my       fair cousins  though my absence may not be long enough to render       it necessary  i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health       and happiness  not excepting my cousin elizabeth          with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew  all of them       equally surprised that he meditated a quick return  mrs  bennet       wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his       addresses to one of her younger girls  and mary might have been       prevailed on to accept him  she rated his abilities much higher       than any of the others  there was a solidity in his reflections       which often struck her  and though by no means so clever as       herself  she thought that if encouraged to read and improve       himself by such an example as hers  he might become a very       agreeable companion  but on the following morning  every hope of       this kind was done away  miss lucas called soon after breakfast        and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of       the day before         the possibility of mr  collins s fancying himself in love with       her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or       two  but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far       from possibility as she could encourage him herself  and her       astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first       the bounds of decorum  and she could not help crying out          engaged to mr  collins  my dear charlotte impossible          the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling       her story  gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so       direct a reproach  though  as it was no more than she expected        she soon regained her composure  and calmly replied          why should you be surprised  my dear eliza  do you think it       incredible that mr  collins should be able to procure any woman s       good opinion  because he was not so happy as to succeed with       you          but elizabeth had now recollected herself  and making a strong       effort for it  was able to assure with tolerable firmness that       the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her        and that she wished her all imaginable happiness          i see what you are feeling   replied charlotte   you must be       surprised  very much surprised so lately as mr  collins was       wishing to marry you  but when you have had time to think it       over  i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done  i am       not romantic  you know  i never was  i ask only a comfortable       home  and considering mr  collins s character  connection  and       situation in life  i am convinced that my chance of happiness       with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the       marriage state          elizabeth quietly answered  undoubtedly   and after an awkward       pause  they returned to the rest of the family  charlotte did not       stay much longer  and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what       she had heard  it was a long time before she became at all       reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match  the strangeness       of mr  collins s making two offers of marriage within three days       was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted  she had       always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly       like her own  but she had not supposed it to be possible that        when called into action  she would have sacrificed every better       feeling to worldly advantage  charlotte the wife of mr  collins       was a most humiliating picture  and to the pang of a friend       disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem  was added the       distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to       be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen              elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters  reflecting on       what she had heard  and doubting whether she was authorised to       mention it  when sir william lucas himself appeared  sent by his       daughter  to announce her engagement to the family  with many       compliments to them  and much self gratulation on the prospect of       a connection between the houses  he unfolded the matter to an       audience not merely wondering  but incredulous  for mrs  bennet        with more perseverance than politeness  protested he must be       entirely mistaken  and lydia  always unguarded and often uncivil        boisterously exclaimed          good lord  sir william  how can you tell such a story  do not       you know that mr  collins wants to marry lizzy          nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne       without anger such treatment  but sir william s good breeding       carried him through it all  and though he begged leave to be       positive as to the truth of his information  he listened to all       their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy         elizabeth  feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so       unpleasant a situation  now put herself forward to confirm his       account  by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte       herself  and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her       mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to       sir william  in which she was readily joined by jane  and by       making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be       expected from the match  the excellent character of mr  collins        and the convenient distance of hunsford from london         mrs  bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal       while sir william remained  but no sooner had he left them than       her feelings found a rapid vent  in the first place  she       persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter  secondly  she       was very sure that mr  collins had been taken in  thirdly  she       trusted that they would never be happy together  and fourthly        that the match might be broken off  two inferences  however  were       plainly deduced from the whole  one  that elizabeth was the real       cause of the mischief  and the other that she herself had been       barbarously misused by them all  and on these two points she       principally dwelt during the rest of the day  nothing could       console and nothing could appease her  nor did that day wear out       her resentment  a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth       without scolding her  a month passed away before she could speak       to sir william or lady lucas without being rude  and many months       were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter         mr  bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion        and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most       agreeable sort  for it gratified him  he said  to discover that       charlotte lucas  whom he had been used to think tolerably       sensible  was as foolish as his wife  and more foolish than his       daughter         jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match  but she       said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for       their happiness  nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it       as improbable  kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas        for mr  collins was only a clergyman  and it affected them in no       other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton         lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to       retort on mrs  bennet the comfort of having a daughter well       married  and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to       say how happy she was  though mrs  bennet s sour looks and       ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness       away         between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept       them mutually silent on the subject  and elizabeth felt persuaded       that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again        her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard       to her sister  of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her       opinion could never be shaken  and for whose happiness she grew       daily more anxious  as bingley had now been gone a week and       nothing more was heard of his return         jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter  and was       counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again        the promised letter of thanks from mr  collins arrived on       tuesday  addressed to their father  and written with all the       solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family       might have prompted  after discharging his conscience on that       head  he proceeded to inform them  with many rapturous       expressions  of his happiness in having obtained the affection of       their amiable neighbour  miss lucas  and then explained that it       was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been       so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at       longbourn  whither he hoped to be able to return on monday       fortnight  for lady catherine  he added  so heartily approved his       marriage  that she wished it to take place as soon as possible        which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his       amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the       happiest of men         mr  collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of       pleasure to mrs  bennet  on the contrary  she was as much       disposed to complain of it as her husband  it was very strange       that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge  it       was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome  she hated       having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent        and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable  such were       the gentle murmurs of mrs  bennet  and they gave way only to the       greater distress of mr  bingley s continued absence         neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject  day       after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him       than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming       no more to netherfield the whole winter  a report which highly       incensed mrs  bennet  and which she never failed to contradict as       a most scandalous falsehood         even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but       that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away        unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s       happiness  and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover  she       could not prevent its frequently occurring  the united efforts of       his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend        assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of       london might be too much  she feared  for the strength of his       attachment         as for jane  her anxiety under this suspense was  of course        more painful than elizabeth s  but whatever she felt she was       desirous of concealing  and between herself and elizabeth        therefore  the subject was never alluded to  but as no such       delicacy restrained her mother  an hour seldom passed in which       she did not talk of bingley  express her impatience for his       arrival  or even require jane to confess that if he did not come       back she would think herself very ill used  it needed all jane s       steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable       tranquillity         mr  collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight  but his       reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been       on his first introduction  he was too happy  however  to need       much attention  and luckily for the others  the business of       love making relieved them from a great deal of his company  the       chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge  and he       sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology       for his absence before the family went to bed         mrs  bennet was really in a most pitiable state  the very mention       of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of       ill humour  and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it       talked of  the sight of miss lucas was odious to her  as her       successor in that house  she regarded her with jealous       abhorrence  whenever charlotte came to see them  she concluded       her to be anticipating the hour of possession  and whenever she       spoke in a low voice to mr  collins  was convinced that they were       talking of the longbourn estate  and resolving to turn herself       and her daughters out of the house  as soon as mr  bennet were       dead  she complained bitterly of all this to her husband          indeed  mr  bennet   said she   it is very hard to think that       charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house  that i       should be forced to make way for her  and live to see her take       her place in it           my dear  do not give way to such gloomy thoughts  let us hope       for better things  let us flatter ourselves that i may be the       survivor          this was not very consoling to mrs  bennet  and therefore        instead of making any answer  she went on as before          i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate  if       it was not for the entail  i should not mind it           what should not you mind           i should not mind anything at all           let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such       insensibility           i never can be thankful  mr  bennet  for anything about the       entail  how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an       estate from one s own daughters  i cannot understand  and all for       the sake of mr  collins too  why should he have it more than       anybody else           i leave it to yourself to determine   said mr  bennet              miss bingley s letter arrived  and put an end to doubt  the very       first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled       in london for the winter  and concluded with her brother s regret       at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in       hertfordshire before he left the country         hope was over  entirely over  and when jane could attend to the       rest of the letter  she found little  except the professed       affection of the writer  that could give her any comfort  miss       darcy s praise occupied the chief of it  her many attractions       were again dwelt on  and caroline boasted joyfully of their       increasing intimacy  and ventured to predict the accomplishment       of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter  she       wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate       of mr  darcy s house  and mentioned with raptures some plans of       the latter with regard to new furniture         elizabeth  to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all       this  heard it in silent indignation  her heart was divided       between concern for her sister  and resentment against all       others  to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to       miss darcy she paid no credit  that he was really fond of jane        she doubted no more than she had ever done  and much as she had       always been disposed to like him  she could not think without       anger  hardly without contempt  on that easiness of temper  that       want of proper resolution  which now made him the slave of his       designing friends  and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness       to the caprice of their inclination  had his own happiness        however  been the only sacrifice  he might have been allowed to       sport with it in whatever manner he thought best  but her       sister s was involved in it  as she thought he must be sensible       himself  it was a subject  in short  on which reflection would be       long indulged  and must be unavailing  she could think of nothing       else  and yet whether bingley s regard had really died away  or       were suppressed by his friends  interference  whether he had been       aware of jane s attachment  or whether it had escaped his       observation  whatever were the case  though her opinion of him       must be materially affected by the difference  her sister s       situation remained the same  her peace equally wounded         a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her       feelings to elizabeth  but at last  on mrs  bennet s leaving them       together  after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield       and its master  she could not help saying          oh  that my dear mother had more command over herself  she can       have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual       reflections on him  but i will not repine  it cannot last long        he will be forgot  and we shall all be as we were before          elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude  but       said nothing          you doubt me   cried jane  slightly colouring   indeed  you have       no reason  he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my       acquaintance  but that is all  i have nothing either to hope or       fear  and nothing to reproach him with  thank god  i have not       that pain  a little time  therefore i shall certainly try to       get the better          with a stronger voice she soon added   i have this comfort       immediately  that it has not been more than an error of fancy on       my side  and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself           my dear jane   exclaimed elizabeth   you are too good  your       sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic  i do not know       what to say to you  i feel as if i had never done you justice  or       loved you as you deserve          miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit  and threw       back the praise on her sister s warm affection          nay   said elizabeth   this is not fair  you wish to think all       the world respectable  and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody        i only want to think you perfect  and you set yourself       against it  do not be afraid of my running into any excess  of my       encroaching on your privilege of universal good will  you need       not  there are few people whom i really love  and still fewer of       whom i think well  the more i see of the world  the more am i       dissatisfied with it  and every day confirms my belief of the       inconsistency of all human characters  and of the little       dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or       sense  i have met with two instances lately  one i will not       mention  the other is charlotte s marriage  it is unaccountable        in every view it is unaccountable           my dear lizzy  do not give way to such feelings as these  they       will ruin your happiness  you do not make allowance enough for       difference of situation and temper  consider mr  collins s       respectability  and charlotte s steady  prudent character        remember that she is one of a large family  that as to fortune        it is a most eligible match  and be ready to believe  for       everybody s sake  that she may feel something like regard and       esteem for our cousin           to oblige you  i would try to believe almost anything  but no       one else could be benefited by such a belief as this  for were i       persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him  i should only       think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart  my       dear jane  mr  collins is a conceited  pompous  narrow minded        silly man  you know he is  as well as i do  and you must feel  as       well as i do  that the woman who married him cannot have a proper       way of thinking  you shall not defend her  though it is charlotte       lucas  you shall not  for the sake of one individual  change the       meaning of principle and integrity  nor endeavour to persuade       yourself or me  that selfishness is prudence  and insensibility       of danger security for happiness           i must think your language too strong in speaking of both         replied jane   and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing       them happy together  but enough of this  you alluded to something       else  you mentioned two instances  i cannot misunderstand you        but i entreat you  dear lizzy  not to pain me by thinking that       person to blame  and saying your opinion of him is sunk  we must       not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured  we must       not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and       circumspect  it is very often nothing but our own vanity that       deceives us  women fancy admiration means more than it does           and men take care that they should           if it is designedly done  they cannot be justified  but i have       no idea of there being so much design in the world as some       persons imagine           i am far from attributing any part of mr  bingley s conduct to       design   said elizabeth   but without scheming to do wrong  or to       make others unhappy  there may be error  and there may be misery        thoughtlessness  want of attention to other people s feelings        and want of resolution  will do the business           and do you impute it to either of those           yes  to the last  but if i go on  i shall displease you by       saying what i think of persons you esteem  stop me whilst you       can           you persist  then  in supposing his sisters influence him           yes  in conjunction with his friend           i cannot believe it  why should they try to influence him  they       can only wish his happiness  and if he is attached to me  no       other woman can secure it           your first position is false  they may wish many things besides       his happiness  they may wish his increase of wealth and       consequence  they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the       importance of money  great connections  and pride           beyond a doubt  they do wish him to choose miss darcy   replied       jane   but this may be from better feelings than you are       supposing  they have known her much longer than they have known       me  no wonder if they love her better  but  whatever may be their       own wishes  it is very unlikely they should have opposed their       brother s  what sister would think herself at liberty to do it        unless there were something very objectionable  if they believed       him attached to me  they would not try to part us  if he were so        they could not succeed  by supposing such an affection  you make       everybody acting unnaturally and wrong  and me most unhappy  do       not distress me by the idea  i am not ashamed of having been       mistaken or  at least  it is light  it is nothing in comparison       of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters  let       me take it in the best light  in the light in which it may be       understood          elizabeth could not oppose such a wish  and from this time mr        bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them         mrs  bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning       no more  and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did       not account for it clearly  there was little chance of her ever       considering it with less perplexity  her daughter endeavoured to       convince her of what she did not believe herself  that his       attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and       transient liking  which ceased when he saw her no more  but       though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time        she had the same story to repeat every day  mrs  bennet s best       comfort was that mr  bingley must be down again in the summer         mr  bennet treated the matter differently   so  lizzy   said he       one day   your sister is crossed in love  i find  i congratulate       her  next to being married  a girl likes to be crossed a little       in love now and then  it is something to think of  and it gives       her a sort of distinction among her companions  when is your turn       to come  you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane  now is       your time  here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all       the young ladies in the country  let wickham be your man  he is a       pleasant fellow  and would jilt you creditably           thank you  sir  but a less agreeable man would satisfy me  we       must not all expect jane s good fortune           true   said mr  bennet   but it is a comfort to think that       whatever of that kind may befall you  you have an affectionate       mother who will make the most of it          mr  wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the       gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of       the longbourn family  they saw him often  and to his other       recommendations was now added that of general unreserve  the       whole of what elizabeth had already heard  his claims on mr        darcy  and all that he had suffered from him  was now openly       acknowledged and publicly canvassed  and everybody was pleased to       know how much they had always disliked mr  darcy before they had       known anything of the matter         miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might       be any extenuating circumstances in the case  unknown to the       society of hertfordshire  her mild and steady candour always       pleaded for allowances  and urged the possibility of mistakes but       by everybody else mr  darcy was condemned as the worst of men              after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of       felicity  mr  collins was called from his amiable charlotte by       the arrival of saturday  the pain of separation  however  might       be alleviated on his side  by preparations for the reception of       his bride  as he had reason to hope  that shortly after his       return into hertfordshire  the day would be fixed that was to       make him the happiest of men  he took leave of his relations at       longbourn with as much solemnity as before  wished his fair       cousins health and happiness again  and promised their father       another letter of thanks         on the following monday  mrs  bennet had the pleasure of       receiving her brother and his wife  who came as usual to spend       the christmas at longbourn  mr  gardiner was a sensible        gentlemanlike man  greatly superior to his sister  as well by       nature as education  the netherfield ladies would have had       difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade  and within       view of his own warehouses  could have been so well bred and       agreeable  mrs  gardiner  who was several years younger than mrs        bennet and mrs  phillips  was an amiable  intelligent  elegant       woman  and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces        between the two eldest and herself especially  there subsisted a       particular regard  they had frequently been staying with her in       town         the first part of mrs  gardiner s business on her arrival was to       distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions  when       this was done she had a less active part to play  it became her       turn to listen  mrs  bennet had many grievances to relate  and       much to complain of  they had all been very ill used since she       last saw her sister  two of her girls had been upon the point of       marriage  and after all there was nothing in it          i do not blame jane   she continued   for jane would have got       mr  bingley if she could  but lizzy  oh  sister  it is very hard       to think that she might have been mr  collins s wife by this       time  had it not been for her own perverseness  he made her an       offer in this very room  and she refused him  the consequence of       it is  that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i       have  and that the longbourn estate is just as much entailed as       ever  the lucases are very artful people indeed  sister  they are       all for what they can get  i am sorry to say it of them  but so       it is  it makes me very nervous and poorly  to be thwarted so in       my own family  and to have neighbours who think of themselves       before anybody else  however  your coming just at this time is       the greatest of comforts  and i am very glad to hear what you       tell us  of long sleeves          mrs  gardiner  to whom the chief of this news had been given       before  in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with       her  made her sister a slight answer  and  in compassion to her       nieces  turned the conversation         when alone with elizabeth afterwards  she spoke more on the       subject   it seems likely to have been a desirable match for       jane   said she   i am sorry it went off  but these things happen       so often  a young man  such as you describe mr  bingley  so       easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks  and when       accident separates them  so easily forgets her  that these sort       of inconsistencies are very frequent           an excellent consolation in its way   said elizabeth   but it       will not do for us  we do not suffer by accident  it does not       often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a       young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom       he was violently in love with only a few days before           but that expression of  violently in love  is so hackneyed  so       doubtful  so indefinite  that it gives me very little idea  it is       as often applied to feelings which arise from a half hour s       acquaintance  as to a real  strong attachment  pray  how violent       was mr  bingley s love           i never saw a more promising inclination  he was growing quite       inattentive to other people  and wholly engrossed by her  every       time they met  it was more decided and remarkable  at his own       ball he offended two or three young ladies  by not asking them to       dance  and i spoke to him twice myself  without receiving an       answer  could there be finer symptoms  is not general incivility       the very essence of love           oh  yes  of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt        poor jane  i am sorry for her  because  with her disposition  she       may not get over it immediately  it had better have happened to       you  lizzy  you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner        but do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us        change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief       from home may be as useful as anything          elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal  and felt       persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence          i hope   added mrs  gardiner   that no consideration with regard       to this young man will influence her  we live in so different a       part of town  all our connections are so different  and  as you       well know  we go out so little  that it is very improbable that       they should meet at all  unless he really comes to see her           and that is quite impossible  for he is now in the custody of       his friend  and mr  darcy would no more suffer him to call on       jane in such a part of london  my dear aunt  how could you think       of it  mr  darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as       gracechurch street  but he would hardly think a month s ablution       enough to cleanse him from its impurities  were he once to enter       it  and depend upon it  mr  bingley never stirs without him           so much the better  i hope they will not meet at all  but does       not jane correspond with his sister  she will not be able to       help calling           she will drop the acquaintance entirely          but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to       place this point  as well as the still more interesting one of       bingley s being withheld from seeing jane  she felt a solicitude       on the subject which convinced her  on examination  that she did       not consider it entirely hopeless  it was possible  and sometimes       she thought it probable  that his affection might be reanimated        and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the       more natural influence of jane s attractions         miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure  and the       bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time  than       as she hoped by caroline s not living in the same house with her       brother  she might occasionally spend a morning with her  without       any danger of seeing him         the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn  and what with the       phillipses  the lucases  and the officers  there was not a day       without its engagement  mrs  bennet had so carefully provided for       the entertainment of her brother and sister  that they did not       once sit down to a family dinner  when the engagement was for       home  some of the officers always made part of it of which       officers mr  wickham was sure to be one  and on these occasions        mrs  gardiner  rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm       commendation  narrowly observed them both  without supposing       them  from what she saw  to be very seriously in love  their       preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little       uneasy  and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject       before she left hertfordshire  and represent to her the       imprudence of encouraging such an attachment         to mrs  gardiner  wickham had one means of affording pleasure        unconnected with his general powers  about ten or a dozen years       ago  before her marriage  she had spent a considerable time in       that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged  they had        therefore  many acquaintances in common  and though wickham had       been little there since the death of darcy s father  it was yet       in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former       friends than she had been in the way of procuring         mrs  gardiner had seen pemberley  and known the late mr  darcy by       character perfectly well  here consequently was an inexhaustible       subject of discourse  in comparing her recollection of pemberley       with the minute description which wickham could give  and in       bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late       possessor  she was delighting both him and herself  on being made       acquainted with the present mr  darcy s treatment of him  she       tried to remember some of that gentleman s reputed disposition       when quite a lad which might agree with it  and was confident at       last that she recollected having heard mr  fitzwilliam darcy       formerly spoken of as a very proud  ill natured boy              mrs  gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly       given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her       alone  after honestly telling her what she thought  she thus went       on          you are too sensible a girl  lizzy  to fall in love merely       because you are warned against it  and  therefore  i am not       afraid of speaking openly  seriously  i would have you be on your       guard  do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an       affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent        i have nothing to say against him  he is a most interesting       young man  and if he had the fortune he ought to have  i should       think you could not do better  but as it is  you must not let       your fancy run away with you  you have sense  and we all expect       you to use it  your father would depend on your resolution and       good conduct  i am sure  you must not disappoint your father           my dear aunt  this is being serious indeed           yes  and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise           well  then  you need not be under any alarm  i will take care of       myself  and of mr  wickham too  he shall not be in love with me        if i can prevent it           elizabeth  you are not serious now           i beg your pardon  i will try again  at present i am not in love       with mr  wickham  no  i certainly am not  but he is  beyond all       comparison  the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes       really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should       not  i see the imprudence of it  oh  that abominable mr  darcy        my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour  and i       should be miserable to forfeit it  my father  however  is partial       to mr  wickham  in short  my dear aunt  i should be very sorry to       be the means of making any of you unhappy  but since we see every       day that where there is affection  young people are seldom       withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into       engagements with each other  how can i promise to be wiser than       so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted  or how am i even       to know that it would be wisdom to resist  all that i can promise       you  therefore  is not to be in a hurry  i will not be in a hurry       to believe myself his first object  when i am in company with       him  i will not be wishing  in short  i will do my best           perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so       very often  at least  you should not remind your mother of       inviting him           as i did the other day   said elizabeth with a conscious smile         very true  it will be wise in me to refrain from that  but do       not imagine that he is always here so often  it is on your       account that he has been so frequently invited this week  you       know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company       for her friends  but really  and upon my honour  i will try to do       what i think to be the wisest  and now i hope you are satisfied          her aunt assured her that she was  and elizabeth having thanked       her for the kindness of her hints  they parted  a wonderful       instance of advice being given on such a point  without being       resented         mr  collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been       quitted by the gardiners and jane  but as he took up his abode       with the lucases  his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs        bennet  his marriage was now fast approaching  and she was at       length so far resigned as to think it inevitable  and even       repeatedly to say  in an ill natured tone  that she  wished       they might be happy   thursday was to be the wedding day  and on       wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit  and when she rose       to take leave  elizabeth  ashamed of her mother s ungracious and       reluctant good wishes  and sincerely affected herself        accompanied her out of the room  as they went downstairs       together  charlotte said          i shall depend on hearing from you very often  eliza           that you certainly shall           and i have another favour to ask you  will you come and see me           we shall often meet  i hope  in hertfordshire           i am not likely to leave kent for some time  promise me        therefore  to come to hunsford          elizabeth could not refuse  though she foresaw little pleasure in       the visit          my father and maria are coming to me in march   added charlotte         and i hope you will consent to be of the party  indeed  eliza        you will be as welcome as either of them          the wedding took place  the bride and bridegroom set off for kent       from the church door  and everybody had as much to say  or to       hear  on the subject as usual  elizabeth soon heard from her       friend  and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as       it had ever been  that it should be equally unreserved was       impossible  elizabeth could never address her without feeling       that all the comfort of intimacy was over  and though determined       not to slacken as a correspondent  it was for the sake of what       had been  rather than what was  charlotte s first letters were       received with a good deal of eagerness  there could not but be       curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home  how she       would like lady catherine  and how happy she would dare pronounce       herself to be  though  when the letters were read  elizabeth felt       that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she       might have foreseen  she wrote cheerfully  seemed surrounded with       comforts  and mentioned nothing which she could not praise  the       house  furniture  neighbourhood  and roads  were all to her       taste  and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and       obliging  it was mr  collins s picture of hunsford and rosings       rationally softened  and elizabeth perceived that she must wait       for her own visit there to know the rest         jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce       their safe arrival in london  and when she wrote again  elizabeth       hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys         her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as       impatience generally is  jane had been a week in town without       either seeing or hearing from caroline  she accounted for it        however  by supposing that her last letter to her friend from       longbourn had by some accident been lost          my aunt   she continued   is going to morrow into that part of       the town  and i shall take the opportunity of calling in       grosvenor street          she wrote again when the visit was paid  and she had seen miss       bingley   i did not think caroline in spirits   were her words         but she was very glad to see me  and reproached me for giving       her no notice of my coming to london  i was right  therefore  my       last letter had never reached her  i enquired after their       brother  of course  he was well  but so much engaged with mr        darcy that they scarcely ever saw him  i found that miss darcy       was expected to dinner  i wish i could see her  my visit was not       long  as caroline and mrs  hurst were going out  i dare say i       shall see them soon here          elizabeth shook her head over this letter  it convinced her that       accident only could discover to mr  bingley her sister s being in       town         four weeks passed away  and jane saw nothing of him  she       endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it  but       she could no longer be blind to miss bingley s inattention  after       waiting at home every morning for a fortnight  and inventing       every evening a fresh excuse for her  the visitor did at last       appear  but the shortness of her stay  and yet more  the       alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no       longer  the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister       will prove what she felt          my dearest lizzy will  i am sure  be incapable of triumphing in       her better judgement  at my expense  when i confess myself to       have been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me  but        my dear sister  though the event has proved you right  do not       think me obstinate if i still assert that  considering what her       behaviour was  my confidence was as natural as your suspicion  i       do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate       with me  but if the same circumstances were to happen again  i am       sure i should be deceived again  caroline did not return my visit       till yesterday  and not a note  not a line  did i receive in the       meantime  when she did come  it was very evident that she had no       pleasure in it  she made a slight  formal apology  for not       calling before  said not a word of wishing to see me again  and       was in every respect so altered a creature  that when she went       away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no       longer  i pity  though i cannot help blaming her  she was very       wrong in singling me out as she did  i can safely say that every       advance to intimacy began on her side  but i pity her  because       she must feel that she has been acting wrong  and because i am       very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it  i need       not explain myself farther  and though we know this anxiety to       be quite needless  yet if she feels it  it will easily account       for her behaviour to me  and so deservedly dear as he is to his       sister  whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural       and amiable  i cannot but wonder  however  at her having any such       fears now  because  if he had at all cared about me  we must have       met  long ago  he knows of my being in town  i am certain  from       something she said herself  and yet it would seem  by her manner       of talking  as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is       really partial to miss darcy  i cannot understand it  if i were       not afraid of judging harshly  i should be almost tempted to say       that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this  but i       will endeavour to banish every painful thought  and think only of       what will make me happy your affection  and the invariable       kindness of my dear uncle and aunt  let me hear from you very       soon  miss bingley said something of his never returning to       netherfield again  of giving up the house  but not with any       certainty  we had better not mention it  i am extremely glad that       you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford        pray go to see them  with sir william and maria  i am sure you       will be very comfortable there  yours  etc          this letter gave elizabeth some pain  but her spirits returned as       she considered that jane would no longer be duped  by the sister       at least  all expectation from the brother was now absolutely       over  she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions        his character sunk on every review of it  and as a punishment for       him  as well as a possible advantage to jane  she seriously hoped       he might really soon marry mr  darcy s sister  as by wickham s       account  she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown       away         mrs  gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise       concerning that gentleman  and required information  and       elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to       her aunt than to herself  his apparent partiality had subsided        his attentions were over  he was the admirer of some one else        elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all  but she could see it       and write of it without material pain  her heart had been but       slightly touched  and her vanity was satisfied with believing       that she would have been his only choice  had fortune permitted       it  the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most       remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering       himself agreeable  but elizabeth  less clear sighted perhaps in       this case than in charlotte s  did not quarrel with him for his       wish of independence  nothing  on the contrary  could be more       natural  and while able to suppose that it cost him a few       struggles to relinquish her  she was ready to allow it a wise and       desirable measure for both  and could very sincerely wish him       happy         all this was acknowledged to mrs  gardiner  and after relating       the circumstances  she thus went on   i am now convinced  my dear       aunt  that i have never been much in love  for had i really       experienced that pure and elevating passion  i should at present       detest his very name  and wish him all manner of evil  but my       feelings are not only cordial towards him  they are even       impartial towards miss king  i cannot find out that i hate her at       all  or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good       sort of girl  there can be no love in all this  my watchfulness       has been effectual  and though i certainly should be a more       interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in       love with him  i cannot say that i regret my comparative       insignificance  importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly        kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do        they are young in the ways of the world  and not yet open to the       mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something       to live on as well as the plain               with no greater events than these in the longbourn family  and       otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton        sometimes dirty and sometimes cold  did january and february pass       away  march was to take elizabeth to hunsford  she had not at       first thought very seriously of going thither  but charlotte  she       soon found  was depending on the plan and she gradually learned       to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater       certainty  absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte       again  and weakened her disgust of mr  collins  there was novelty       in the scheme  and as  with such a mother and such       uncompanionable sisters  home could not be faultless  a little       change was not unwelcome for its own sake  the journey would       moreover give her a peep at jane  and  in short  as the time drew       near  she would have been very sorry for any delay  everything        however  went on smoothly  and was finally settled according to       charlotte s first sketch  she was to accompany sir william and       his second daughter  the improvement of spending a night in       london was added in time  and the plan became perfect as plan       could be         the only pain was in leaving her father  who would certainly miss       her  and who  when it came to the point  so little liked her       going  that he told her to write to him  and almost promised to       answer her letter         the farewell between herself and mr  wickham was perfectly       friendly  on his side even more  his present pursuit could not       make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and       to deserve his attention  the first to listen and to pity  the       first to be admired  and in his manner of bidding her adieu        wishing her every enjoyment  reminding her of what she was to       expect in lady catherine de bourgh  and trusting their opinion of       her their opinion of everybody would always coincide  there was a       solicitude  an interest which she felt must ever attach her to       him with a most sincere regard  and she parted from him convinced       that  whether married or single  he must always be her model of       the amiable and pleasing         her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her       think him less agreeable  sir william lucas  and his daughter       maria  a good humoured girl  but as empty headed as himself  had       nothing to say that could be worth hearing  and were listened to       with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise  elizabeth       loved absurdities  but she had known sir william s too long  he       could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and       knighthood  and his civilities were worn out  like his       information         it was a journey of only twenty four miles  and they began it so       early as to be in gracechurch street by noon  as they drove to       mr  gardiner s door  jane was at a drawing room window watching       their arrival  when they entered the passage she was there to       welcome them  and elizabeth  looking earnestly in her face  was       pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever  on the stairs       were a troop of little boys and girls  whose eagerness for their       cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the       drawing room  and whose shyness  as they had not seen her for a       twelvemonth  prevented their coming lower  all was joy and       kindness  the day passed most pleasantly away  the morning in       bustle and shopping  and the evening at one of the theatres         elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt  their first object       was her sister  and she was more grieved than astonished to hear        in reply to her minute enquiries  that though jane always       struggled to support her spirits  there were periods of       dejection  it was reasonable  however  to hope that they would       not continue long  mrs  gardiner gave her the particulars also of       miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street  and repeated       conversations occurring at different times between jane and       herself  which proved that the former had  from her heart  given       up the acquaintance         mrs  gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion  and       complimented her on bearing it so well          but my dear elizabeth   she added   what sort of girl is miss       king  i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary           pray  my dear aunt  what is the difference in matrimonial       affairs  between the mercenary and the prudent motive  where does       discretion end  and avarice begin  last christmas you were afraid       of his marrying me  because it would be imprudent  and now        because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds        you want to find out that he is mercenary           if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is  i shall       know what to think           she is a very good kind of girl  i believe  i know no harm of       her           but he paid her not the smallest attention till her       grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune           no why should he  if it were not allowable for him to gain my       affections because i had no money  what occasion could there be       for making love to a girl whom he did not care about  and who was       equally poor           but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions       towards her so soon after this event           a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those       elegant decorums which other people may observe  if she does       not object to it  why should we           her not objecting does not justify him  it only shows her       being deficient in something herself sense or feeling           well   cried elizabeth   have it as you choose  he shall be       mercenary  and she shall be foolish           no  lizzy  that is what i do not choose  i should be sorry        you know  to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in       derbyshire           oh  if that is all  i have a very poor opinion of young men who       live in derbyshire  and their intimate friends who live in       hertfordshire are not much better  i am sick of them all  thank       heaven  i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not       one agreeable quality  who has neither manner nor sense to       recommend him  stupid men are the only ones worth knowing  after       all           take care  lizzy  that speech savours strongly of       disappointment          before they were separated by the conclusion of the play  she had       the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle       and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the       summer          we have not determined how far it shall carry us   said mrs        gardiner   but  perhaps  to the lakes          no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth  and her       acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful   oh  my       dear  dear aunt   she rapturously cried   what delight  what       felicity  you give me fresh life and vigour  adieu to       disappointment and spleen  what are young men to rocks and       mountains  oh  what hours of transport we shall spend  and when       we do return  it shall not be like other travellers  without       being able to give one accurate idea of anything  we will know       where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen  lakes        mountains  and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our       imaginations  nor when we attempt to describe any particular       scene  will we begin quarreling about its relative situation  let       our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the       generality of travellers               every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to       elizabeth  and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment  for she       had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her       health  and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant       source of delight         when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford  every eye       was in search of the parsonage  and every turning expected to       bring it in view  the palings of rosings park was their boundary       on one side  elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she       had heard of its inhabitants         at length the parsonage was discernible  the garden sloping to       the road  the house standing in it  the green pales  and the       laurel hedge  everything declared they were arriving  mr  collins       and charlotte appeared at the door  and the carriage stopped at       the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house        amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party  in a moment they       were all out of the chaise  rejoicing at the sight of each other        mrs  collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure  and       elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found       herself so affectionately received  she saw instantly that her       cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage  his formal       civility was just what it had been  and he detained her some       minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all       her family  they were then  with no other delay than his pointing       out the neatness of the entrance  taken into the house  and as       soon as they were in the parlour  he welcomed them a second time        with ostentatious formality to his humble abode  and punctually       repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment         elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory  and she could not       help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the       room  its aspect and its furniture  he addressed himself       particularly to her  as if wishing to make her feel what she had       lost in refusing him  but though everything seemed neat and       comfortable  she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of       repentance  and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she       could have so cheerful an air with such a companion  when mr        collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be       ashamed  which certainly was not unseldom  she involuntarily       turned her eye on charlotte  once or twice she could discern a       faint blush  but in general charlotte wisely did not hear  after       sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the       room  from the sideboard to the fender  to give an account of       their journey  and of all that had happened in london  mr        collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden  which was       large and well laid out  and to the cultivation of which he       attended himself  to work in this garden was one of his most       respectable pleasures  and elizabeth admired the command of       countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of       the exercise  and owned she encouraged it as much as possible        here  leading the way through every walk and cross walk  and       scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked       for  every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left       beauty entirely behind  he could number the fields in every       direction  and could tell how many trees there were in the most       distant clump  but of all the views which his garden  or which       the country or kingdom could boast  none were to be compared with       the prospect of rosings  afforded by an opening in the trees that       bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house  it was       a handsome modern building  well situated on rising ground         from his garden  mr  collins would have led them round his two       meadows  but the ladies  not having shoes to encounter the       remains of a white frost  turned back  and while sir william       accompanied him  charlotte took her sister and friend over the       house  extremely well pleased  probably  to have the opportunity       of showing it without her husband s help  it was rather small        but well built and convenient  and everything was fitted up and       arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave       charlotte all the credit  when mr  collins could be forgotten        there was really an air of great comfort throughout  and by       charlotte s evident enjoyment of it  elizabeth supposed he must       be often forgotten         she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the       country  it was spoken of again while they were at dinner  when       mr  collins joining in  observed          yes  miss elizabeth  you will have the honour of seeing lady       catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church  and i need       not say you will be delighted with her  she is all affability and       condescension  and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some       portion of her notice when service is over  i have scarcely any       hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in       every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here        her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming  we dine at       rosings twice every week  and are never allowed to walk home  her       ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us  i should say        one of her ladyship s carriages  for she has several           lady catherine is a very respectable  sensible woman indeed         added charlotte   and a most attentive neighbour           very true  my dear  that is exactly what i say  she is the sort       of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference          the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news        and telling again what had already been written  and when it       closed  elizabeth  in the solitude of her chamber  had to       meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment  to understand       her address in guiding  and composure in bearing with  her       husband  and to acknowledge that it was all done very well  she       had also to anticipate how her visit would pass  the quiet tenor       of their usual employments  the vexatious interruptions of mr        collins  and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings  a       lively imagination soon settled it all         about the middle of the next day  as she was in her room getting       ready for a walk  a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole       house in confusion  and  after listening a moment  she heard       somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry  and calling loudly       after her  she opened the door and met maria in the landing       place  who  breathless with agitation  cried out          oh  my dear eliza  pray make haste and come into the       dining room  for there is such a sight to be seen  i will not       tell you what it is  make haste  and come down this moment          elizabeth asked questions in vain  maria would tell her nothing       more  and down they ran into the dining room  which fronted the       lane  in quest of this wonder  it was two ladies stopping in a       low phaeton at the garden gate          and is this all   cried elizabeth   i expected at least that the       pigs were got into the garden  and here is nothing but lady       catherine and her daughter           la  my dear   said maria  quite shocked at the mistake   it is       not lady catherine  the old lady is mrs  jenkinson  who lives       with them  the other is miss de bourgh  only look at her  she is       quite a little creature  who would have thought that she could be       so thin and small           she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all       this wind  why does she not come in           oh  charlotte says she hardly ever does  it is the greatest of       favours when miss de bourgh comes in           i like her appearance   said elizabeth  struck with other ideas         she looks sickly and cross  yes  she will do for him very well        she will make him a very proper wife          mr  collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in       conversation with the ladies  and sir william  to elizabeth s       high diversion  was stationed in the doorway  in earnest       contemplation of the greatness before him  and constantly bowing       whenever miss de bourgh looked that way         at length there was nothing more to be said  the ladies drove on        and the others returned into the house  mr  collins no sooner saw       the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good       fortune  which charlotte explained by letting them know that the       whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day              mr  collins s triumph  in consequence of this invitation  was       complete  the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness       to his wondering visitors  and of letting them see her civility       towards himself and his wife  was exactly what he had wished for        and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon  was       such an instance of lady catherine s condescension  as he knew       not how to admire enough          i confess   said he   that i should not have been at all       surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and       spend the evening at rosings  i rather expected  from my       knowledge of her affability  that it would happen  but who could       have foreseen such an attention as this  who could have imagined       that we should receive an invitation to dine there  an       invitation  moreover  including the whole party  so immediately       after your arrival           i am the less surprised at what has happened   replied sir       william   from that knowledge of what the manners of the great       really are  which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire        about the court  such instances of elegant breeding are not       uncommon          scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but       their visit to rosings  mr  collins was carefully instructing       them in what they were to expect  that the sight of such rooms        so many servants  and so splendid a dinner  might not wholly       overpower them         when the ladies were separating for the toilette  he said to       elizabeth          do not make yourself uneasy  my dear cousin  about your apparel        lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us       which becomes herself and her daughter  i would advise you merely       to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there       is no occasion for anything more  lady catherine will not think       the worse of you for being simply dressed  she likes to have the       distinction of rank preserved          while they were dressing  he came two or three times to their       different doors  to recommend their being quick  as lady       catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner        such formidable accounts of her ladyship  and her manner of       living  quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to       company  and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings       with as much apprehension as her father had done to his       presentation at st  james s         as the weather was fine  they had a pleasant walk of about half a       mile across the park  every park has its beauty and its       prospects  and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with  though she       could not be in such raptures as mr  collins expected the scene       to inspire  and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of       the windows in front of the house  and his relation of what the       glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh         when they ascended the steps to the hall  maria s alarm was every       moment increasing  and even sir william did not look perfectly       calm  elizabeth s courage did not fail her  she had heard nothing       of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary       talents or miraculous virtue  and the mere stateliness of money       or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation         from the entrance hall  of which mr  collins pointed out  with a       rapturous air  the fine proportion and the finished ornaments        they followed the servants through an ante chamber  to the room       where lady catherine  her daughter  and mrs  jenkinson were       sitting  her ladyship  with great condescension  arose to receive       them  and as mrs  collins had settled it with her husband that       the office of introduction should be hers  it was performed in a       proper manner  without any of those apologies and thanks which he       would have thought necessary         in spite of having been at st  james s  sir william was so       completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him  that he had but       just courage enough to make a very low bow  and take his seat       without saying a word  and his daughter  frightened almost out of       her senses  sat on the edge of her chair  not knowing which way       to look  elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene  and       could observe the three ladies before her composedly  lady       catherine was a tall  large woman  with strongly marked features        which might once have been handsome  her air was not       conciliating  nor was her manner of receiving them such as to       make her visitors forget their inferior rank  she was not       rendered formidable by silence  but whatever she said was spoken       in so authoritative a tone  as marked her self importance  and       brought mr  wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind  and from the       observation of the day altogether  she believed lady catherine to       be exactly what he represented         when  after examining the mother  in whose countenance and       deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr  darcy  she       turned her eyes on the daughter  she could almost have joined in       maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small  there was       neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies  miss       de bourgh was pale and sickly  her features  though not plain        were insignificant  and she spoke very little  except in a low       voice  to mrs  jenkinson  in whose appearance there was nothing       remarkable  and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she       said  and placing a screen in the proper direction before her       eyes         after sitting a few minutes  they were all sent to one of the       windows to admire the view  mr  collins attending them to point       out its beauties  and lady catherine kindly informing them that       it was much better worth looking at in the summer         the dinner was exceedingly handsome  and there were all the       servants and all the articles of plate which mr  collins had       promised  and  as he had likewise foretold  he took his seat at       the bottom of the table  by her ladyship s desire  and looked as       if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater  he carved        and ate  and praised with delighted alacrity  and every dish was       commended  first by him and then by sir william  who was now       enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said  in a       manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear  but       lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration        and gave most gracious smiles  especially when any dish on the       table proved a novelty to them  the party did not supply much       conversation  elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an       opening  but she was seated between charlotte and miss de       bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady       catherine  and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time        mrs  jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss       de bourgh ate  pressing her to try some other dish  and fearing       she was indisposed  maria thought speaking out of the question        and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire         when the ladies returned to the drawing room  there was little to       be done but to hear lady catherine talk  which she did without       any intermission till coffee came in  delivering her opinion on       every subject in so decisive a manner  as proved that she was not       used to have her judgement controverted  she enquired into       charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely  gave her a       great deal of advice as to the management of them all  told her       how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as       hers  and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her       poultry  elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great       lady s attention  which could furnish her with an occasion of       dictating to others  in the intervals of her discourse with mrs        collins  she addressed a variety of questions to maria and       elizabeth  but especially to the latter  of whose connections she       knew the least  and who she observed to mrs  collins was a very       genteel  pretty kind of girl  she asked her  at different times        how many sisters she had  whether they were older or younger than       herself  whether any of them were likely to be married  whether       they were handsome  where they had been educated  what carriage       her father kept  and what had been her mother s maiden name        elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered       them very composedly  lady catherine then observed          your father s estate is entailed on mr  collins  i think  for       your sake   turning to charlotte   i am glad of it  but otherwise       i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line  it       was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family  do you       play and sing  miss bennet           a little           oh  then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you  our       instrument is a capital one  probably superior to  you shall try       it some day  do your sisters play and sing           one of them does           why did not you all learn  you ought all to have learned  the       miss webbs all play  and their father has not so good an income       as yours  do you draw           no  not at all           what  none of you           not one           that is very strange  but i suppose you had no opportunity  your       mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit       of masters           my mother would have had no objection  but my father hates       london           has your governess left you           we never had any governess           no governess  how was that possible  five daughters brought up       at home without a governess  i never heard of such a thing  your       mother must have been quite a slave to your education          elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had       not been the case          then  who taught you  who attended to you  without a governess        you must have been neglected           compared with some families  i believe we were  but such of us       as wished to learn never wanted the means  we were always       encouraged to read  and had all the masters that were necessary        those who chose to be idle  certainly might           aye  no doubt  but that is what a governess will prevent  and if       i had known your mother  i should have advised her most       strenuously to engage one  i always say that nothing is to be       done in education without steady and regular instruction  and       nobody but a governess can give it  it is wonderful how many       families i have been the means of supplying in that way  i am       always glad to get a young person well placed out  four nieces of       mrs  jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means        and it was but the other day that i recommended another young       person  who was merely accidentally mentioned to me  and the       family are quite delighted with her  mrs  collins  did i tell you       of lady metcalf s calling yesterday to thank me  she finds miss       pope a treasure   lady catherine   said she   you have given me a       treasure   are any of your younger sisters out  miss bennet           yes  ma am  all           all  what  all five out at once  very odd  and you only the       second  the younger ones out before the elder ones are married        your younger sisters must be very young           yes  my youngest is not sixteen  perhaps she is full young to       be much in company  but really  ma am  i think it would be very       hard upon younger sisters  that they should not have their share       of society and amusement  because the elder may not have the       means or inclination to marry early  the last born has as good a       right to the pleasures of youth as the first  and to be kept back       on such a motive  i think it would not be very likely to       promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind           upon my word   said her ladyship   you give your opinion very       decidedly for so young a person  pray  what is your age           with three younger sisters grown up   replied elizabeth        smiling   your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it          lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct       answer  and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature       who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence          you cannot be more than twenty  i am sure  therefore you need       not conceal your age           i am not one and twenty          when the gentlemen had joined them  and tea was over  the       card tables were placed  lady catherine  sir william  and mr  and       mrs  collins sat down to quadrille  and as miss de bourgh chose       to play at cassino  the two girls had the honour of assisting       mrs  jenkinson to make up her party  their table was       superlatively stupid  scarcely a syllable was uttered that did       not relate to the game  except when mrs  jenkinson expressed her       fears of miss de bourgh s being too hot or too cold  or having       too much or too little light  a great deal more passed at the       other table  lady catherine was generally speaking stating the       mistakes of the three others  or relating some anecdote of       herself  mr  collins was employed in agreeing to everything her       ladyship said  thanking her for every fish he won  and       apologising if he thought he won too many  sir william did not       say much  he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble       names         when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they       chose  the tables were broken up  the carriage was offered to       mrs  collins  gratefully accepted and immediately ordered  the       party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine       determine what weather they were to have on the morrow  from       these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the       coach  and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr  collins s       side and as many bows on sir william s they departed  as soon as       they had driven from the door  elizabeth was called on by her       cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings        which  for charlotte s sake  she made more favourable than it       really was  but her commendation  though costing her some       trouble  could by no means satisfy mr  collins  and he was very       soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands              sir william stayed only a week at hunsford  but his visit was       long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most       comfortably settled  and of her possessing such a husband and       such a neighbour as were not often met with  while sir william       was with them  mr  collins devoted his morning to driving him out       in his gig  and showing him the country  but when he went away        the whole family returned to their usual employments  and       elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her       cousin by the alteration  for the chief of the time between       breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the       garden or in reading and writing  and looking out of the window       in his own book room  which fronted the road  the room in which       the ladies sat was backwards  elizabeth had at first rather       wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for       common use  it was a better sized room  and had a more pleasant       aspect  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason       for what she did  for mr  collins would undoubtedly have been       much less in his own apartment  had they sat in one equally       lively  and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement         from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane        and were indebted to mr  collins for the knowledge of what       carriages went along  and how often especially miss de bourgh       drove by in her phaeton  which he never failed coming to inform       them of  though it happened almost every day  she not       unfrequently stopped at the parsonage  and had a few minutes        conversation with charlotte  but was scarcely ever prevailed upon       to get out         very few days passed in which mr  collins did not walk to       rosings  and not many in which his wife did not think it       necessary to go likewise  and till elizabeth recollected that       there might be other family livings to be disposed of  she could       not understand the sacrifice of so many hours  now and then they       were honoured with a call from her ladyship  and nothing escaped       her observation that was passing in the room during these visits        she examined into their employments  looked at their work  and       advised them to do it differently  found fault with the       arrangement of the furniture  or detected the housemaid in       negligence  and if she accepted any refreshment  seemed to do it       only for the sake of finding out that mrs  collins s joints of       meat were too large for her family         elizabeth soon perceived  that though this great lady was not in       the commission of the peace of the county  she was a most active       magistrate in her own parish  the minutest concerns of which were       carried to her by mr  collins  and whenever any of the cottagers       were disposed to be quarrelsome  discontented  or too poor  she       sallied forth into the village to settle their differences        silence their complaints  and scold them into harmony and plenty         the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a       week  and  allowing for the loss of sir william  and there being       only one card table in the evening  every such entertainment was       the counterpart of the first  their other engagements were few        as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond       mr  collins s reach  this  however  was no evil to elizabeth  and       upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough  there were       half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte  and the       weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great       enjoyment out of doors  her favourite walk  and where she       frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine        was along the open grove which edged that side of the park  where       there was a nice sheltered path  which no one seemed to value but       herself  and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s       curiosity         in this quiet way  the first fortnight of her visit soon passed       away  easter was approaching  and the week preceding it was to       bring an addition to the family at rosings  which in so small a       circle must be important  elizabeth had heard soon after her       arrival that mr  darcy was expected there in the course of a few       weeks  and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom       she did not prefer  his coming would furnish one comparatively       new to look at in their rosings parties  and she might be amused       in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were  by his       behaviour to his cousin  for whom he was evidently destined by       lady catherine  who talked of his coming with the greatest       satisfaction  spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration        and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been       frequently seen by miss lucas and herself         his arrival was soon known at the parsonage  for mr  collins was       walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into       hunsford lane  in order to have the earliest assurance of it  and       after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park        hurried home with the great intelligence  on the following       morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects  there were       two nephews of lady catherine to require them  for mr  darcy had       brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam  the younger son of his       uncle lord     and  to the great surprise of all the party  when       mr  collins returned  the gentlemen accompanied him  charlotte       had seen them from her husband s room  crossing the road  and       immediately running into the other  told the girls what an honour       they might expect  adding          i may thank you  eliza  for this piece of civility  mr  darcy       would never have come so soon to wait upon me          elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the       compliment  before their approach was announced by the door bell        and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room        colonel fitzwilliam  who led the way  was about thirty  not       handsome  but in person and address most truly the gentleman  mr        darcy looked just as he had been used to look in       hertfordshire paid his compliments  with his usual reserve  to       mrs  collins  and whatever might be his feelings toward her       friend  met her with every appearance of composure  elizabeth       merely curtseyed to him without saying a word         colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the       readiness and ease of a well bred man  and talked very       pleasantly  but his cousin  after having addressed a slight       observation on the house and garden to mrs  collins  sat for some       time without speaking to anybody  at length  however  his       civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the       health of her family  she answered him in the usual way  and       after a moment s pause  added          my eldest sister has been in town these three months  have you       never happened to see her there          she was perfectly sensible that he never had  but she wished to       see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed       between the bingleys and jane  and she thought he looked a little       confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to       meet miss bennet  the subject was pursued no farther  and the       gentlemen soon afterwards went away              colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the       parsonage  and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably       to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings  it was some       days  however  before they received any invitation thither for       while there were visitors in the house  they could not be       necessary  and it was not till easter day  almost a week after       the gentlemen s arrival  that they were honoured by such an       attention  and then they were merely asked on leaving church to       come there in the evening  for the last week they had seen very       little of lady catherine or her daughter  colonel fitzwilliam had       called at the parsonage more than once during the time  but mr        darcy they had seen only at church         the invitation was accepted of course  and at a proper hour they       joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room  her ladyship       received them civilly  but it was plain that their company was by       no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else  and she       was  in fact  almost engrossed by her nephews  speaking to them        especially to darcy  much more than to any other person in the       room         colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them  anything was       a welcome relief to him at rosings  and mrs  collins s pretty       friend had moreover caught his fancy very much  he now seated       himself by her  and talked so agreeably of kent and       hertfordshire  of travelling and staying at home  of new books       and music  that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained       in that room before  and they conversed with so much spirit and       flow  as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself  as well       as of mr  darcy  his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned       towards them with a look of curiosity  and that her ladyship        after a while  shared the feeling  was more openly acknowledged        for she did not scruple to call out          what is that you are saying  fitzwilliam  what is it you are       talking of  what are you telling miss bennet  let me hear what it       is           we are speaking of music  madam   said he  when no longer able       to avoid a reply          of music  then pray speak aloud  it is of all subjects my       delight  i must have my share in the conversation if you are       speaking of music  there are few people in england  i suppose        who have more true enjoyment of music than myself  or a better       natural taste  if i had ever learnt  i should have been a great       proficient  and so would anne  if her health had allowed her to       apply  i am confident that she would have performed delightfully        how does georgiana get on  darcy          mr  darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s       proficiency          i am very glad to hear such a good account of her   said lady       catherine   and pray tell her from me  that she cannot expect to       excel if she does not practice a good deal           i assure you  madam   he replied   that she does not need such       advice  she practises very constantly           so much the better  it cannot be done too much  and when i next       write to her  i shall charge her not to neglect it on any       account  i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is       to be acquired without constant practice  i have told miss bennet       several times  that she will never play really well unless she       practises more  and though mrs  collins has no instrument  she is       very welcome  as i have often told her  to come to rosings every       day  and play on the pianoforte in mrs  jenkinson s room  she       would be in nobody s way  you know  in that part of the house          mr  darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding  and       made no answer         when coffee was over  colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of       having promised to play to him  and she sat down directly to the       instrument  he drew a chair near her  lady catherine listened to       half a song  and then talked  as before  to her other nephew        till the latter walked away from her  and making with his usual       deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to       command a full view of the fair performer s countenance        elizabeth saw what he was doing  and at the first convenient       pause  turned to him with an arch smile  and said          you mean to frighten me  mr  darcy  by coming in all this state       to hear me  i will not be alarmed though your sister does play       so well  there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to       be frightened at the will of others  my courage always rises at       every attempt to intimidate me           i shall not say you are mistaken   he replied   because you       could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming       you  and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough       to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing       opinions which in fact are not your own          elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself  and said       to colonel fitzwilliam   your cousin will give you a very pretty       notion of me  and teach you not to believe a word i say  i am       particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose       my real character  in a part of the world where i had hoped to       pass myself off with some degree of credit  indeed  mr  darcy  it       is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my       disadvantage in hertfordshire and  give me leave to say  very       impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate  and such       things may come out as will shock your relations to hear           i am not afraid of you   said he  smilingly          pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of   cried colonel       fitzwilliam   i should like to know how he behaves among       strangers           you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very       dreadful  the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire        you must know  was at a ball and at this ball  what do you think       he did  he danced only four dances  though gentlemen were scarce        and  to my certain knowledge  more than one young lady was       sitting down in want of a partner  mr  darcy  you cannot deny the       fact           i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the       assembly beyond my own party           true  and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room  well        colonel fitzwilliam  what do i play next  my fingers wait your       orders           perhaps   said darcy   i should have judged better  had i sought       an introduction  but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to       strangers           shall we ask your cousin the reason of this   said elizabeth        still addressing colonel fitzwilliam   shall we ask him why a man       of sense and education  and who has lived in the world  is ill       qualified to recommend himself to strangers           i can answer your question   said fitzwilliam   without applying       to him  it is because he will not give himself the trouble           i certainly have not the talent which some people possess   said       darcy   of conversing easily with those i have never seen before        i cannot catch their tone of conversation  or appear interested       in their concerns  as i often see done           my fingers   said elizabeth   do not move over this instrument       in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do  they have       not the same force or rapidity  and do not produce the same       expression  but then i have always supposed it to be my own       fault because i will not take the trouble of practising  it is       not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other       woman s of superior execution          darcy smiled and said   you are perfectly right  you have       employed your time much better  no one admitted to the privilege       of hearing you can think anything wanting  we neither of us       perform to strangers          here they were interrupted by lady catherine  who called out to       know what they were talking of  elizabeth immediately began       playing again  lady catherine approached  and  after listening       for a few minutes  said to darcy          miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more        and could have the advantage of a london master  she has a very       good notion of fingering  though her taste is not equal to       anne s  anne would have been a delightful performer  had her       health allowed her to learn          elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his       cousin s praise  but neither at that moment nor at any other       could she discern any symptom of love  and from the whole of his       behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss       bingley  that he might have been just as likely to marry her        had she been his relation         lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance        mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste        elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility        and  at the request of the gentlemen  remained at the instrument       till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home              elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning  and writing to       jane while mrs  collins and maria were gone on business into the       village  when she was startled by a ring at the door  the certain       signal of a visitor  as she had heard no carriage  she thought it       not unlikely to be lady catherine  and under that apprehension       was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape       all impertinent questions  when the door opened  and  to her very       great surprise  mr  darcy  and mr  darcy only  entered the room         he seemed astonished too on finding her alone  and apologised for       his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the       ladies were to be within         they then sat down  and when her enquiries after rosings were       made  seemed in danger of sinking into total silence  it was       absolutely necessary  therefore  to think of something  and in       this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in       hertfordshire  and feeling curious to know what he would say on       the subject of their hasty departure  she observed          how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november  mr        darcy  it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr  bingley       to see you all after him so soon  for  if i recollect right  he       went but the day before  he and his sisters were well  i hope        when you left london           perfectly so  i thank you          she found that she was to receive no other answer  and  after a       short pause added          i think i have understood that mr  bingley has not much idea of       ever returning to netherfield again           i have never heard him say so  but it is probable that he may       spend very little of his time there in the future  he has many       friends  and is at a time of life when friends and engagements       are continually increasing           if he means to be but little at netherfield  it would be better       for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely        for then we might possibly get a settled family there  but        perhaps  mr  bingley did not take the house so much for the       convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own  and we must       expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle           i should not be surprised   said darcy   if he were to give it       up as soon as any eligible purchase offers          elizabeth made no answer  she was afraid of talking longer of his       friend  and  having nothing else to say  was now determined to       leave the trouble of finding a subject to him         he took the hint  and soon began with   this seems a very       comfortable house  lady catherine  i believe  did a great deal to       it when mr  collins first came to hunsford           i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her       kindness on a more grateful object           mr  collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a       wife           yes  indeed  his friends may well rejoice in his having met with       one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him        or have made him happy if they had  my friend has an excellent       understanding though i am not certain that i consider her       marrying mr  collins as the wisest thing she ever did  she seems       perfectly happy  however  and in a prudential light it is       certainly a very good match for her           it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a       distance of her own family and friends           an easy distance  do you call it  it is nearly fifty miles           and what is fifty miles of good road  little more than half a       day s journey  yes  i call it a very easy distance           i should never have considered the distance as one of the       advantages of the match   cried elizabeth   i should never have       said mrs  collins was settled near her family           it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire  anything       beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn  i suppose  would       appear far          as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she       understood  he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and       netherfield  and she blushed as she answered          i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near       her family  the far and the near must be relative  and depend on       many varying circumstances  where there is fortune to make the       expenses of travelling unimportant  distance becomes no evil  but       that is not the case here  mr  and mrs  collins have a       comfortable income  but not such a one as will allow of frequent       journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself       near her family under less than half the present distance          mr  darcy drew his chair a little towards her  and said   you       cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment  you       cannot have been always at longbourn          elizabeth looked surprised  the gentleman experienced some change       of feeling  he drew back his chair  took a newspaper from the       table  and glancing over it  said  in a colder voice          are you pleased with kent          a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued  on either       side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of       charlotte and her sister  just returned from her walk  the       tête à tête surprised them  mr  darcy related the mistake which       had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet  and after sitting a       few minutes longer without saying much to anybody  went away          what can be the meaning of this   said charlotte  as soon as he       was gone   my dear  eliza  he must be in love with you  or he       would never have called on us in this familiar way          but when elizabeth told of his silence  it did not seem very       likely  even to charlotte s wishes  to be the case  and after       various conjectures  they could at last only suppose his visit to       proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do  which was       the more probable from the time of year  all field sports were       over  within doors there was lady catherine  books  and a       billiard table  but gentlemen cannot always be within doors  and       in the nearness of the parsonage  or the pleasantness of the walk       to it  or of the people who lived in it  the two cousins found a       temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day        they called at various times of the morning  sometimes       separately  sometimes together  and now and then accompanied by       their aunt  it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam       came because he had pleasure in their society  a persuasion which       of course recommended him still more  and elizabeth was reminded       by her own satisfaction in being with him  as well as by his       evident admiration of her  of her former favourite george       wickham  and though  in comparing them  she saw there was less       captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners  she       believed he might have the best informed mind         but why mr  darcy came so often to the parsonage  it was more       difficult to understand  it could not be for society  as he       frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his       lips  and when he did speak  it seemed the effect of necessity       rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety  not a pleasure to       himself  he seldom appeared really animated  mrs  collins knew       not what to make of him  colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally       laughing at his stupidity  proved that he was generally       different  which her own knowledge of him could not have told       her  and as she would liked to have believed this change the       effect of love  and the object of that love her friend eliza  she       set herself seriously to work to find it out  she watched him       whenever they were at rosings  and whenever he came to hunsford        but without much success  he certainly looked at her friend a       great deal  but the expression of that look was disputable  it       was an earnest  steadfast gaze  but she often doubted whether       there were much admiration in it  and sometimes it seemed nothing       but absence of mind         she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of       his being partial to her  but elizabeth always laughed at the       idea  and mrs  collins did not think it right to press the       subject  from the danger of raising expectations which might only       end in disappointment  for in her opinion it admitted not of a       doubt  that all her friend s dislike would vanish  if she could       suppose him to be in her power         in her kind schemes for elizabeth  she sometimes planned her       marrying colonel fitzwilliam  he was beyond comparison the most       pleasant man  he certainly admired her  and his situation in life       was most eligible  but  to counterbalance these advantages  mr        darcy had considerable patronage in the church  and his cousin       could have none at all              more than once did elizabeth  in her ramble within the park        unexpectedly meet mr  darcy  she felt all the perverseness of the       mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought        and  to prevent its ever happening again  took care to inform him       at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers  how it could       occur a second time  therefore  was very odd  yet it did  and       even a third  it seemed like wilful ill nature  or a voluntary       penance  for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal       enquiries and an awkward pause and then away  but he actually       thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her  he never       said a great deal  nor did she give herself the trouble of       talking or of listening much  but it struck her in the course of       their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected       questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford  her love of       solitary walks  and her opinion of mr  and mrs  collins s       happiness  and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly       understanding the house  he seemed to expect that whenever she       came into kent again she would be staying there too  his words       seemed to imply it  could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his       thoughts  she supposed  if he meant anything  he must mean an       allusion to what might arise in that quarter  it distressed her a       little  and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the       pales opposite the parsonage         she was engaged one day as she walked  in perusing jane s last       letter  and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had       not written in spirits  when  instead of being again surprised by       mr  darcy  she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was       meeting her  putting away the letter immediately and forcing a       smile  she said          i did not know before that you ever walked this way           i have been making the tour of the park   he replied   as i       generally do every year  and intend to close it with a call at       the parsonage  are you going much farther           no  i should have turned in a moment          and accordingly she did turn  and they walked towards the       parsonage together          do you certainly leave kent on saturday   said she          yes if darcy does not put it off again  but i am at his       disposal  he arranges the business just as he pleases           and if not able to please himself in the arrangement  he has at       least pleasure in the great power of choice  i do not know       anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes       than mr  darcy           he likes to have his own way very well   replied colonel       fitzwilliam   but so we all do  it is only that he has better       means of having it than many others  because he is rich  and many       others are poor  i speak feelingly  a younger son  you know  must       be inured to self denial and dependence           in my opinion  the younger son of an earl can know very little       of either  now seriously  what have you ever known of self denial       and dependence  when have you been prevented by want of money       from going wherever you chose  or procuring anything you had a       fancy for           these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have       experienced many hardships of that nature  but in matters of       greater weight  i may suffer from want of money  younger sons       cannot marry where they like           unless where they like women of fortune  which i think they very       often do           our habits of expense make us too dependent  and there are not       many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some       attention to money           is this   thought elizabeth   meant for me   and she coloured at       the idea  but  recovering herself  said in a lively tone   and       pray  what is the usual price of an earl s younger son  unless       the elder brother is very sickly  i suppose you would not ask       above fifty thousand pounds          he answered her in the same style  and the subject dropped  to       interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with       what had passed  she soon afterwards said          i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the       sake of having someone at his disposal  i wonder he does not       marry  to secure a lasting convenience of that kind  but        perhaps  his sister does as well for the present  and  as she is       under his sole care  he may do what he likes with her           no   said colonel fitzwilliam   that is an advantage which he       must divide with me  i am joined with him in the guardianship of       miss darcy           are you indeed  and pray what sort of guardians do you make        does your charge give you much trouble  young ladies of her age       are sometimes a little difficult to manage  and if she has the       true darcy spirit  she may like to have her own way          as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly  and the       manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss       darcy likely to give them any uneasiness  convinced her that she       had somehow or other got pretty near the truth  she directly       replied          you need not be frightened  i never heard any harm of her  and i       dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world        she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my       acquaintance  mrs  hurst and miss bingley  i think i have heard       you say that you know them           i know them a little  their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike       man he is a great friend of darcy s           oh  yes   said elizabeth drily   mr  darcy is uncommonly kind to       mr  bingley  and takes a prodigious deal of care of him           care of him  yes  i really believe darcy does take care of him       in those points where he most wants care  from something that he       told me in our journey hither  i have reason to think bingley       very much indebted to him  but i ought to beg his pardon  for i       have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant  it       was all conjecture           what is it you mean           it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally       known  because if it were to get round to the lady s family  it       would be an unpleasant thing           you may depend upon my not mentioning it           and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be       bingley  what he told me was merely this  that he congratulated       himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences       of a most imprudent marriage  but without mentioning names or any       other particulars  and i only suspected it to be bingley from       believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that       sort  and from knowing them to have been together the whole of       last summer           did mr  darcy give you reasons for this interference           i understood that there were some very strong objections against       the lady           and what arts did he use to separate them           he did not talk to me of his own arts   said fitzwilliam        smiling   he only told me what i have now told you          elizabeth made no answer  and walked on  her heart swelling with       indignation  after watching her a little  fitzwilliam asked her       why she was so thoughtful          i am thinking of what you have been telling me   said she   your       cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings  why was he to be the       judge           you are rather disposed to call his interference officious           i do not see what right mr  darcy had to decide on the propriety       of his friend s inclination  or why  upon his own judgement       alone  he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend       was to be happy  but   she continued  recollecting herself   as       we know none of the particulars  it is not fair to condemn him        it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the       case           that is not an unnatural surmise   said fitzwilliam   but it is       a lessening of the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly          this was spoken jestingly  but it appeared to her so just a       picture of mr  darcy  that she would not trust herself with an       answer  and therefore  abruptly changing the conversation talked       on indifferent matters until they reached the parsonage  there        shut into her own room  as soon as their visitor left them  she       could think without interruption of all that she had heard  it       was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than       those with whom she was connected  there could not exist in the       world two men over whom mr  darcy could have such boundless       influence  that he had been concerned in the measures taken to       separate bingley and jane she had never doubted  but she had       always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and       arrangement of them  if his own vanity  however  did not mislead       him  he was the cause  his pride and caprice were the cause  of       all that jane had suffered  and still continued to suffer  he had       ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most       affectionate  generous heart in the world  and no one could say       how lasting an evil he might have inflicted          there were some very strong objections against the lady   were       colonel fitzwilliam s words  and those strong objections probably       were  her having one uncle who was a country attorney  and       another who was in business in london          to jane herself   she exclaimed   there could be no possibility       of objection  all loveliness and goodness as she is  her       understanding excellent  her mind improved  and her manners       captivating  neither could anything be urged against my father        who  though with some peculiarities  has abilities mr  darcy       himself need not disdain  and respectability which he will       probably never reach   when she thought of her mother  her       confidence gave way a little  but she would not allow that any       objections there had material weight with mr  darcy  whose       pride  she was convinced  would receive a deeper wound from the       want of importance in his friend s connections  than from their       want of sense  and she was quite decided  at last  that he had       been partly governed by this worst kind of pride  and partly by       the wish of retaining mr  bingley for his sister         the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned  brought on       a headache  and it grew so much worse towards the evening  that        added to her unwillingness to see mr  darcy  it determined her       not to attend her cousins to rosings  where they were engaged to       drink tea  mrs  collins  seeing that she was really unwell  did       not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband       from pressing her  but mr  collins could not conceal his       apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her       staying at home              when they were gone  elizabeth  as if intending to exasperate       herself as much as possible against mr  darcy  chose for her       employment the examination of all the letters which jane had       written to her since her being in kent  they contained no actual       complaint  nor was there any revival of past occurrences  or any       communication of present suffering  but in all  and in almost       every line of each  there was a want of that cheerfulness which       had been used to characterise her style  and which  proceeding       from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly       disposed towards everyone  had been scarcely ever clouded        elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of       uneasiness  with an attention which it had hardly received on the       first perusal  mr  darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had       been able to inflict  gave her a keener sense of her sister s       sufferings  it was some consolation to think that his visit to       rosings was to end on the day after the next and  a still       greater  that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with       jane again  and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her       spirits  by all that affection could do         she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering       that his cousin was to go with him  but colonel fitzwilliam had       made it clear that he had no intentions at all  and agreeable as       he was  she did not mean to be unhappy about him         while settling this point  she was suddenly roused by the sound       of the door bell  and her spirits were a little fluttered by the       idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself  who had once       before called late in the evening  and might now come to enquire       particularly after her  but this idea was soon banished  and her       spirits were very differently affected  when  to her utter       amazement  she saw mr  darcy walk into the room  in an hurried       manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health  imputing       his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better  she answered       him with cold civility  he sat down for a few moments  and then       getting up  walked about the room  elizabeth was surprised  but       said not a word  after a silence of several minutes  he came       towards her in an agitated manner  and thus began          in vain i have struggled  it will not do  my feelings will not       be repressed  you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire       and love you          elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression  she stared        coloured  doubted  and was silent  this he considered sufficient       encouragement  and the avowal of all that he felt  and had long       felt for her  immediately followed  he spoke well  but there were       feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed  and he was       not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride  his       sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family       obstacles which had always opposed to inclination  were dwelt on       with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was       wounding  but was very unlikely to recommend his suit         in spite of her deeply rooted dislike  she could not be       insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection  and       though her intentions did not vary for an instant  she was at       first sorry for the pain he was to receive  till  roused to       resentment by his subsequent language  she lost all compassion in       anger  she tried  however  to compose herself to answer him with       patience  when he should have done  he concluded with       representing to her the strength of that attachment which  in       spite of all his endeavours  he had found impossible to conquer        and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her       acceptance of his hand  as he said this  she could easily see       that he had no doubt of a favourable answer  he spoke of       apprehension and anxiety  but his countenance expressed real       security  such a circumstance could only exasperate farther  and        when he ceased  the colour rose into her cheeks  and she said          in such cases as this  it is  i believe  the established mode to       express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed  however       unequally they may be returned  it is natural that obligation       should be felt  and if i could feel gratitude  i would now       thank you  but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion        and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly  i am sorry       to have occasioned pain to anyone  it has been most unconsciously       done  however  and i hope will be of short duration  the feelings       which  you tell me  have long prevented the acknowledgment of       your regard  can have little difficulty in overcoming it after       this explanation          mr  darcy  who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes       fixed on her face  seemed to catch her words with no less       resentment than surprise  his complexion became pale with anger        and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature  he       was struggling for the appearance of composure  and would not       open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it  the       pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful  at length  with a       voice of forced calmness  he said          and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of       expecting  i might  perhaps  wish to be informed why  with so       little endeavour at civility  i am thus rejected  but it is of       small importance           i might as well enquire   replied she   why with so evident a       desire of offending and insulting me  you chose to tell me that       you liked me against your will  against your reason  and even       against your character  was not this some excuse for incivility        if i was uncivil  but i have other provocations  you know i       have  had not my feelings decided against you had they been       indifferent  or had they even been favourable  do you think that       any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been       the means of ruining  perhaps for ever  the happiness of a most       beloved sister          as she pronounced these words  mr  darcy changed colour  but the       emotion was short  and he listened without attempting to       interrupt her while she continued          i have every reason in the world to think ill of you  no motive       can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there  you       dare not  you cannot deny  that you have been the principal  if       not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing       one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability  and       the other to its derision for disappointed hopes  and involving       them both in misery of the acutest kind          she paused  and saw with no slight indignation that he was       listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any       feeling of remorse  he even looked at her with a smile of       affected incredulity          can you deny that you have done it   she repeated         with assumed tranquillity he then replied   i have no wish of       denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend       from your sister  or that i rejoice in my success  towards him       i have been kinder than towards myself          elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil       reflection  but its meaning did not escape  nor was it likely to       conciliate her          but it is not merely this affair   she continued   on which my       dislike is founded  long before it had taken place my opinion of       you was decided  your character was unfolded in the recital which       i received many months ago from mr  wickham  on this subject        what can you have to say  in what imaginary act of friendship can       you here defend yourself  or under what misrepresentation can you       here impose upon others           you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns   said       darcy  in a less tranquil tone  and with a heightened colour          who that knows what his misfortunes have been  can help feeling       an interest in him           his misfortunes   repeated darcy contemptuously   yes  his       misfortunes have been great indeed           and of your infliction   cried elizabeth with energy   you have       reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty        you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been       designed for him  you have deprived the best years of his life of       that independence which was no less his due than his desert  you       have done all this  and yet you can treat the mention of his       misfortune with contempt and ridicule           and this   cried darcy  as he walked with quick steps across the       room   is your opinion of me  this is the estimation in which you       hold me  i thank you for explaining it so fully  my faults        according to this calculation  are heavy indeed  but perhaps         added he  stopping in his walk  and turning towards her   these       offenses might have been overlooked  had not your pride been hurt       by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented       my forming any serious design  these bitter accusations might       have been suppressed  had i  with greater policy  concealed my       struggles  and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled       by unqualified  unalloyed inclination  by reason  by reflection        by everything  but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence  nor       am i ashamed of the feelings i related  they were natural and       just  could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your       connections  to congratulate myself on the hope of relations        whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own          elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment  yet she       tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said          you are mistaken  mr  darcy  if you suppose that the mode of       your declaration affected me in any other way  than as it spared       me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you  had you       behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner          she saw him start at this  but he said nothing  and she       continued          you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible       way that would have tempted me to accept it          again his astonishment was obvious  and he looked at her with an       expression of mingled incredulity and mortification  she went on          from the very beginning from the first moment  i may almost       say of my acquaintance with you  your manners  impressing me with       the fullest belief of your arrogance  your conceit  and your       selfish disdain of the feelings of others  were such as to form       the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have       built so immovable a dislike  and i had not known you a month       before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i       could ever be prevailed on to marry           you have said quite enough  madam  i perfectly comprehend your       feelings  and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have       been  forgive me for having taken up so much of your time  and       accept my best wishes for your health and happiness          and with these words he hastily left the room  and elizabeth       heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house         the tumult of her mind  was now painfully great  she knew not how       to support herself  and from actual weakness sat down and cried       for half an hour  her astonishment  as she reflected on what had       passed  was increased by every review of it  that she should       receive an offer of marriage from mr  darcy  that he should have       been in love with her for so many months  so much in love as to       wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made       him prevent his friend s marrying her sister  and which must       appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost       incredible  it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so       strong an affection  but his pride  his abominable pride his       shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his       unpardonable assurance in acknowledging  though he could not       justify it  and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned       mr  wickham  his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to       deny  soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his       attachment had for a moment excited  she continued in very       agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage       made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s       observation  and hurried her away to her room              elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and       meditations which had at length closed her eyes  she could not       yet recover from the surprise of what had happened  it was       impossible to think of anything else  and  totally indisposed for       employment  she resolved  soon after breakfast  to indulge       herself in air and exercise  she was proceeding directly to her       favourite walk  when the recollection of mr  darcy s sometimes       coming there stopped her  and instead of entering the park  she       turned up the lane  which led farther from the turnpike road  the       park paling was still the boundary on one side  and she soon       passed one of the gates into the ground         after walking two or three times along that part of the lane  she       was tempted  by the pleasantness of the morning  to stop at the       gates and look into the park  the five weeks which she had now       passed in kent had made a great difference in the country  and       every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees  she was       on the point of continuing her walk  when she caught a glimpse of       a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park  he was       moving that way  and  fearful of its being mr  darcy  she was       directly retreating  but the person who advanced was now near       enough to see her  and stepping forward with eagerness        pronounced her name  she had turned away  but on hearing herself       called  though in a voice which proved it to be mr  darcy  she       moved again towards the gate  he had by that time reached it       also  and  holding out a letter  which she instinctively took        said  with a look of haughty composure   i have been walking in       the grove some time in the hope of meeting you  will you do me       the honour of reading that letter   and then  with a slight bow        turned again into the plantation  and was soon out of sight         with no expectation of pleasure  but with the strongest       curiosity  elizabeth opened the letter  and  to her still       increasing wonder  perceived an envelope containing two sheets of       letter paper  written quite through  in a very close hand  the       envelope itself was likewise full  pursuing her way along the       lane  she then began it  it was dated from rosings  at eight       o clock in the morning  and was as follows           be not alarmed  madam  on receiving this letter  by the       apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments       or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to       you  i write without any intention of paining you  or humbling       myself  by dwelling on wishes which  for the happiness of both        cannot be too soon forgotten  and the effort which the formation       and the perusal of this letter must occasion  should have been       spared  had not my character required it to be written and read        you must  therefore  pardon the freedom with which i demand your       attention  your feelings  i know  will bestow it unwillingly  but       i demand it of your justice          two offenses of a very different nature  and by no means of       equal magnitude  you last night laid to my charge  the first       mentioned was  that  regardless of the sentiments of either  i       had detached mr  bingley from your sister  and the other  that i       had  in defiance of various claims  in defiance of honour and       humanity  ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the       prospects of mr  wickham  wilfully and wantonly to have thrown       off the companion of my youth  the acknowledged favourite of my       father  a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on       our patronage  and who had been brought up to expect its       exertion  would be a depravity  to which the separation of two       young persons  whose affection could be the growth of only a few       weeks  could bear no comparison  but from the severity of that       blame which was last night so liberally bestowed  respecting each       circumstance  i shall hope to be in the future secured  when the       following account of my actions and their motives has been read        if  in the explanation of them  which is due to myself  i am       under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive       to yours  i can only say that i am sorry  the necessity must be       obeyed  and further apology would be absurd          i had not been long in hertfordshire  before i saw  in common       with others  that bingley preferred your elder sister to any       other young woman in the country  but it was not till the evening       of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his       feeling a serious attachment  i had often seen him in love       before  at that ball  while i had the honour of dancing with you        i was first made acquainted  by sir william lucas s accidental       information  that bingley s attentions to your sister had given       rise to a general expectation of their marriage  he spoke of it       as a certain event  of which the time alone could be undecided        from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively        and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was       beyond what i had ever witnessed in him  your sister i also       watched  her look and manners were open  cheerful  and engaging       as ever  but without any symptom of peculiar regard  and i       remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny  that though she       received his attentions with pleasure  she did not invite them by       any participation of sentiment  if you have not been mistaken       here  i must have been in error  your superior knowledge of       your sister must make the latter probable  if it be so  if i have       been misled by such error to inflict pain on her  your resentment       has not been unreasonable  but i shall not scruple to assert        that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such       as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that        however amiable her temper  her heart was not likely to be easily       touched  that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is       certain but i will venture to say that my investigation and       decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears  i did       not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it  i believed       it on impartial conviction  as truly as i wished it in reason  my       objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last       night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion       to put aside  in my own case  the want of connection could not be       so great an evil to my friend as to me  but there were other       causes of repugnance  causes which  though still existing  and       existing to an equal degree in both instances  i had myself       endeavoured to forget  because they were not immediately before       me  these causes must be stated  though briefly  the situation of       your mother s family  though objectionable  was nothing in       comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently  so       almost uniformly betrayed by herself  by your three younger       sisters  and occasionally even by your father  pardon me  it       pains me to offend you  but amidst your concern for the defects       of your nearest relations  and your displeasure at this       representation of them  let it give you consolation to consider       that  to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of       the like censure  is praise no less generally bestowed on you and       your elder sister  than it is honourable to the sense and       disposition of both  i will only say farther that from what       passed that evening  my opinion of all parties was confirmed  and       every inducement heightened which could have led me before  to       preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy       connection  he left netherfield for london  on the day following        as you  i am certain  remember  with the design of soon       returning          the part which i acted is now to be explained  his sisters        uneasiness had been equally excited with my own  our coincidence       of feeling was soon discovered  and  alike sensible that no time       was to be lost in detaching their brother  we shortly resolved on       joining him directly in london  we accordingly went and there i       readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the       certain evils of such a choice  i described  and enforced them       earnestly  but  however this remonstrance might have staggered or       delayed his determination  i do not suppose that it would       ultimately have prevented the marriage  had it not been seconded       by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving  of your sister s       indifference  he had before believed her to return his affection       with sincere  if not with equal regard  but bingley has great       natural modesty  with a stronger dependence on my judgement than       on his own  to convince him  therefore  that he had deceived       himself  was no very difficult point  to persuade him against       returning into hertfordshire  when that conviction had been       given  was scarcely the work of a moment  i cannot blame myself       for having done thus much  there is but one part of my conduct in       the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction  it       is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to       conceal from him your sister s being in town  i knew it myself        as it was known to miss bingley  but her brother is even yet       ignorant of it  that they might have met without ill consequence       is perhaps probable  but his regard did not appear to me enough       extinguished for him to see her without some danger  perhaps this       concealment  this disguise was beneath me  it is done  however        and it was done for the best  on this subject i have nothing more       to say  no other apology to offer  if i have wounded your       sister s feelings  it was unknowingly done and though the motives       which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient        i have not yet learnt to condemn them          with respect to that other  more weighty accusation  of having       injured mr  wickham  i can only refute it by laying before you       the whole of his connection with my family  of what he has       particularly accused me i am ignorant  but of the truth of what       i shall relate  i can summon more than one witness of undoubted       veracity          mr  wickham is the son of a very respectable man  who had for       many years the management of all the pemberley estates  and whose       good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my       father to be of service to him  and on george wickham  who was       his godson  his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed  my       father supported him at school  and afterwards at cambridge most       important assistance  as his own father  always poor from the       extravagance of his wife  would have been unable to give him a       gentleman s education  my father was not only fond of this young       man s society  whose manners were always engaging  he had also       the highest opinion of him  and hoping the church would be his       profession  intended to provide for him in it  as for myself  it       is many  many years since i first began to think of him in a very       different manner  the vicious propensities the want of principle        which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best       friend  could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly       the same age with himself  and who had opportunities of seeing       him in unguarded moments  which mr  darcy could not have  here       again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell  but       whatever may be the sentiments which mr  wickham has created  a       suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his       real character it adds even another motive          my excellent father died about five years ago  and his       attachment to mr  wickham was to the last so steady  that in his       will he particularly recommended it to me  to promote his       advancement in the best manner that his profession might       allow and if he took orders  desired that a valuable family       living might be his as soon as it became vacant  there was also a       legacy of one thousand pounds  his own father did not long       survive mine  and within half a year from these events  mr        wickham wrote to inform me that  having finally resolved against       taking orders  he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for       him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage  in lieu of       the preferment  by which he could not be benefited  he had some       intention  he added  of studying law  and i must be aware that       the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient       support therein  i rather wished  than believed him to be       sincere  but  at any rate  was perfectly ready to accede to his       proposal  i knew that mr  wickham ought not to be a clergyman        the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to       assistance in the church  were it possible that he could ever be       in a situation to receive it  and accepted in return three       thousand pounds  all connection between us seemed now dissolved        i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley  or admit his       society in town  in town i believe he chiefly lived  but his       studying the law was a mere pretence  and being now free from all       restraint  his life was a life of idleness and dissipation  for       about three years i heard little of him  but on the decease of       the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him  he       applied to me again by letter for the presentation  his       circumstances  he assured me  and i had no difficulty in       believing it  were exceedingly bad  he had found the law a most       unprofitable study  and was now absolutely resolved on being       ordained  if i would present him to the living in question of       which he trusted there could be little doubt  as he was well       assured that i had no other person to provide for  and i could       not have forgotten my revered father s intentions  you will       hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty  or for       resisting every repetition to it  his resentment was in       proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was       doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his       reproaches to myself  after this period every appearance of       acquaintance was dropped  how he lived i know not  but last       summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice          i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget       myself  and which no obligation less than the present should       induce me to unfold to any human being  having said thus much  i       feel no doubt of your secrecy  my sister  who is more than ten       years my junior  was left to the guardianship of my mother s       nephew  colonel fitzwilliam  and myself  about a year ago  she       was taken from school  and an establishment formed for her in       london  and last summer she went with the lady who presided over       it  to ramsgate  and thither also went mr  wickham  undoubtedly       by design  for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance       between him and mrs  younge  in whose character we were most       unhappily deceived  and by her connivance and aid  he so far       recommended himself to georgiana  whose affectionate heart       retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child        that she was persuaded to believe herself in love  and to consent       to an elopement  she was then but fifteen  which must be her       excuse  and after stating her imprudence  i am happy to add  that       i owed the knowledge of it to herself  i joined them unexpectedly       a day or two before the intended elopement  and then georgiana        unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother       whom she almost looked up to as a father  acknowledged the whole       to me  you may imagine what i felt and how i acted  regard for my       sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure  but i       wrote to mr  wickham  who left the place immediately  and mrs        younge was of course removed from her charge  mr  wickham s chief       object was unquestionably my sister s fortune  which is thirty       thousand pounds  but i cannot help supposing that the hope of       revenging himself on me was a strong inducement  his revenge       would have been complete indeed          this  madam  is a faithful narrative of every event in which we       have been concerned together  and if you do not absolutely reject       it as false  you will  i hope  acquit me henceforth of cruelty       towards mr  wickham  i know not in what manner  under what form       of falsehood he had imposed on you  but his success is not       perhaps to be wondered at  ignorant as you previously were of       everything concerning either  detection could not be in your       power  and suspicion certainly not in your inclination          you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last       night  but i was not then master enough of myself to know what       could or ought to be revealed  for the truth of everything here       related  i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of       colonel fitzwilliam  who  from our near relationship and constant       intimacy  and  still more  as one of the executors of my father s       will  has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of       these transactions  if your abhorrence of me should make my       assertions valueless  you cannot be prevented by the same cause       from confiding in my cousin  and that there may be the       possibility of consulting him  i shall endeavour to find some       opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of       the morning  i will only add  god bless you          fitzwilliam darcy              if elizabeth  when mr  darcy gave her the letter  did not expect       it to contain a renewal of his offers  she had formed no       expectation at all of its contents  but such as they were  it may       well be supposed how eagerly she went through them  and what a       contrariety of emotion they excited  her feelings as she read       were scarcely to be defined  with amazement did she first       understand that he believed any apology to be in his power  and       steadfastly was she persuaded  that he could have no explanation       to give  which a just sense of shame would not conceal  with a       strong prejudice against everything he might say  she began his       account of what had happened at netherfield  she read with an       eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension  and from       impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring  was       incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes        his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved       to be false  and his account of the real  the worst objections to       the match  made her too angry to have any wish of doing him       justice  he expressed no regret for what he had done which       satisfied her  his style was not penitent  but haughty  it was       all pride and insolence         but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr        wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation       of events which  if true  must overthrow every cherished opinion       of his worth  and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own       history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and       more difficult of definition  astonishment  apprehension  and       even horror  oppressed her  she wished to discredit it entirely        repeatedly exclaiming   this must be false  this cannot be  this       must be the grossest falsehood   and when she had gone through       the whole letter  though scarcely knowing anything of the last       page or two  put it hastily away  protesting that she would not       regard it  that she would never look in it again         in this perturbed state of mind  with thoughts that could rest on       nothing  she walked on  but it would not do  in half a minute the       letter was unfolded again  and collecting herself as well as she       could  she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related       to wickham  and commanded herself so far as to examine the       meaning of every sentence  the account of his connection with the       pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself  and the       kindness of the late mr  darcy  though she had not before known       its extent  agreed equally well with his own words  so far each       recital confirmed the other  but when she came to the will  the       difference was great  what wickham had said of the living was       fresh in her memory  and as she recalled his very words  it was       impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side       or the other  and  for a few moments  she flattered herself that       her wishes did not err  but when she read and re read with the       closest attention  the particulars immediately following of       wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living  of his       receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds        again was she forced to hesitate  she put down the letter        weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be       impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but       with little success  on both sides it was only assertion  again       she read on  but every line proved more clearly that the affair        which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could       so represent as to render mr  darcy s conduct in it less than       infamous  was capable of a turn which must make him entirely       blameless throughout the whole         the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to       lay at mr  wickham s charge  exceedingly shocked her  the more       so  as she could bring no proof of its injustice  she had never       heard of him before his entrance into the   shire militia  in       which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who  on       meeting him accidentally in town  had there renewed a slight       acquaintance  of his former way of life nothing had been known in       hertfordshire but what he told himself  as to his real character        had information been in her power  she had never felt a wish of       enquiring  his countenance  voice  and manner had established him       at once in the possession of every virtue  she tried to recollect       some instance of goodness  some distinguished trait of integrity       or benevolence  that might rescue him from the attacks of mr        darcy  or at least  by the predominance of virtue  atone for       those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what       mr  darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years        continuance  but no such recollection befriended her  she could       see him instantly before her  in every charm of air and address        but she could remember no more substantial good than the general       approbation of the neighbourhood  and the regard which his social       powers had gained him in the mess  after pausing on this point a       considerable while  she once more continued to read  but  alas        the story which followed  of his designs on miss darcy  received       some confirmation from what had passed between colonel       fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before  and at last she       was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel       fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the       information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs  and       whose character she had no reason to question  at one time she       had almost resolved on applying to him  but the idea was checked       by the awkwardness of the application  and at length wholly       banished by the conviction that mr  darcy would never have       hazarded such a proposal  if he had not been well assured of his       cousin s corroboration         she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in       conversation between wickham and herself  in their first evening       at mr  phillips s  many of his expressions were still fresh in       her memory  she was now struck with the impropriety of such       communications to a stranger  and wondered it had escaped her       before  she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he       had done  and the inconsistency of his professions with his       conduct  she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of       seeing mr  darcy that mr  darcy might leave the country  but that       he should stand his ground  yet he had avoided the netherfield       ball the very next week  she remembered also that  till the       netherfield family had quitted the country  he had told his story       to no one but herself  but that after their removal it had been       everywhere discussed  that he had then no reserves  no scruples       in sinking mr  darcy s character  though he had assured her that       respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son         how differently did everything now appear in which he was       concerned  his attentions to miss king were now the consequence       of views solely and hatefully mercenary  and the mediocrity of       her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes  but       his eagerness to grasp at anything  his behaviour to herself       could now have had no tolerable motive  he had either been       deceived with regard to her fortune  or had been gratifying his       vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had       most incautiously shown  every lingering struggle in his favour       grew fainter and fainter  and in farther justification of mr        darcy  she could not but allow that mr  bingley  when questioned       by jane  had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair        that proud and repulsive as were his manners  she had never  in       the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had       latterly brought them much together  and given her a sort of       intimacy with his ways seen anything that betrayed him to be       unprincipled or unjust anything that spoke him of irreligious or       immoral habits  that among his own connections he was esteemed       and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother        and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his       sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling  that had       his actions been what mr  wickham represented them  so gross a       violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed       from the world  and that friendship between a person capable of       it  and such an amiable man as mr  bingley  was incomprehensible         she grew absolutely ashamed of herself  of neither darcy nor       wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind        partial  prejudiced  absurd          how despicably i have acted   she cried   i  who have prided       myself on my discernment  i  who have valued myself on my       abilities  who have often disdained the generous candour of my       sister  and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust        how humiliating is this discovery  yet  how just a humiliation        had i been in love  i could not have been more wretchedly blind        but vanity  not love  has been my folly  pleased with the       preference of one  and offended by the neglect of the other  on       the very beginning of our acquaintance  i have courted       prepossession and ignorance  and driven reason away  where either       were concerned  till this moment i never knew myself          from herself to jane from jane to bingley  her thoughts were in a       line which soon brought to her recollection that mr  darcy s       explanation there had appeared very insufficient  and she read       it again  widely different was the effect of a second perusal        how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance        which she had been obliged to give in the other  he declared       himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment        and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had       always been  neither could she deny the justice of his       description of jane  she felt that jane s feelings  though       fervent  were little displayed  and that there was a constant       complacency in her air and manner not often united with great       sensibility         when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were       mentioned in terms of such mortifying  yet merited reproach  her       sense of shame was severe  the justice of the charge struck her       too forcibly for denial  and the circumstances to which he       particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball        and as confirming all his first disapprobation  could not have       made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers         the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt  it       soothed  but it could not console her for the contempt which had       thus been self attracted by the rest of her family  and as she       considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work       of her nearest relations  and reflected how materially the credit       of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct  she felt       depressed beyond anything she had ever known before         after wandering along the lane for two hours  giving way to every       variety of thought re considering events  determining       probabilities  and reconciling herself  as well as she could  to       a change so sudden and so important  fatigue  and a recollection       of her long absence  made her at length return home  and she       entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual        and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make       her unfit for conversation         she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had       each called during her absence  mr  darcy  only for a few       minutes  to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been       sitting with them at least an hour  hoping for her return  and       almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found        elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him  she       really rejoiced at it  colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an       object  she could think only of her letter              the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning  and mr  collins       having been in waiting near the lodges  to make them his parting       obeisance  was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence  of       their appearing in very good health  and in as tolerable spirits       as could be expected  after the melancholy scene so lately gone       through at rosings  to rosings he then hastened  to console lady       catherine and her daughter  and on his return brought back  with       great satisfaction  a message from her ladyship  importing that       she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having       them all to dine with her         elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that        had she chosen it  she might by this time have been presented to       her as her future niece  nor could she think  without a smile  of       what her ladyship s indignation would have been   what would she       have said  how would she have behaved   were questions with which       she amused herself         their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party   i       assure you  i feel it exceedingly   said lady catherine   i       believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as i do  but i       am particularly attached to these young men  and know them to be       so much attached to me  they were excessively sorry to go  but so       they always are  the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably       till just at last  but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely        more  i think  than last year  his attachment to rosings       certainly increases          mr  collins had a compliment  and an allusion to throw in here        which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter         lady catherine observed  after dinner  that miss bennet seemed       out of spirits  and immediately accounting for it herself  by       supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon  she       added          but if that is the case  you must write to your mother and beg       that you may stay a little longer  mrs  collins will be very glad       of your company  i am sure           i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation         replied elizabeth   but it is not in my power to accept it  i       must be in town next saturday           why  at that rate  you will have been here only six weeks  i       expected you to stay two months  i told mrs  collins so before       you came  there can be no occasion for your going so soon  mrs        bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight           but my father cannot  he wrote last week to hurry my return           oh  your father of course may spare you  if your mother can        daughters are never of so much consequence to a father  and if       you will stay another month complete  it will be in my power to       take one of you as far as london  for i am going there early in       june  for a week  and as dawson does not object to the       barouche box  there will be very good room for one of you and       indeed  if the weather should happen to be cool  i should not       object to taking you both  as you are neither of you large           you are all kindness  madam  but i believe we must abide by our       original plan          lady catherine seemed resigned   mrs  collins  you must send a       servant with them  you know i always speak my mind  and i cannot       bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves        it is highly improper  you must contrive to send somebody  i have       the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing  young       women should always be properly guarded and attended  according       to their situation in life  when my niece georgiana went to       ramsgate last summer  i made a point of her having two       men servants go with her  miss darcy  the daughter of mr  darcy        of pemberley  and lady anne  could not have appeared with       propriety in a different manner  i am excessively attentive to       all those things  you must send john with the young ladies  mrs        collins  i am glad it occurred to me to mention it  for it would       really be discreditable to you to let them go alone           my uncle is to send a servant for us           oh  your uncle  he keeps a man servant  does he  i am very glad       you have somebody who thinks of these things  where shall you       change horses  oh  bromley  of course  if you mention my name at       the bell  you will be attended to          lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their       journey  and as she did not answer them all herself  attention       was necessary  which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her  or        with a mind so occupied  she might have forgotten where she was        reflection must be reserved for solitary hours  whenever she was       alone  she gave way to it as the greatest relief  and not a day       went by without a solitary walk  in which she might indulge in       all the delight of unpleasant recollections         mr  darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by       heart  she studied every sentence  and her feelings towards its       writer were at times widely different  when she remembered the       style of his address  she was still full of indignation  but when       she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him        her anger was turned against herself  and his disappointed       feelings became the object of compassion  his attachment excited       gratitude  his general character respect  but she could not       approve him  nor could she for a moment repent her refusal  or       feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again  in her own       past behaviour  there was a constant source of vexation and       regret  and in the unhappy defects of her family  a subject of       yet heavier chagrin  they were hopeless of remedy  her father        contented with laughing at them  would never exert himself to       restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters  and her       mother  with manners so far from right herself  was entirely       insensible of the evil  elizabeth had frequently united with jane       in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia        but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence  what       chance could there be of improvement  catherine  weak spirited        irritable  and completely under lydia s guidance  had been always       affronted by their advice  and lydia  self willed and careless        would scarcely give them a hearing  they were ignorant  idle  and       vain  while there was an officer in meryton  they would flirt       with him  and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn  they       would be going there forever         anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern  and mr        darcy s explanation  by restoring bingley to all her former good       opinion  heightened the sense of what jane had lost  his       affection was proved to have been sincere  and his conduct       cleared of all blame  unless any could attach to the implicitness       of his confidence in his friend  how grievous then was the       thought that  of a situation so desirable in every respect  so       replete with advantage  so promising for happiness  jane had been       deprived  by the folly and indecorum of her own family         when to these recollections was added the development of       wickham s character  it may be easily believed that the happy       spirits which had seldom been depressed before  were now so much       affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear       tolerably cheerful         their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last       week of her stay as they had been at first  the very last evening       was spent there  and her ladyship again enquired minutely into       the particulars of their journey  gave them directions as to the       best method of packing  and was so urgent on the necessity of       placing gowns in the only right way  that maria thought herself       obliged  on her return  to undo all the work of the morning  and       pack her trunk afresh         when they parted  lady catherine  with great condescension        wished them a good journey  and invited them to come to hunsford       again next year  and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to       curtsey and hold out her hand to both              on saturday morning elizabeth and mr  collins met for breakfast a       few minutes before the others appeared  and he took the       opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed       indispensably necessary          i know not  miss elizabeth   said he   whether mrs  collins has       yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us  but i       am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving       her thanks for it  the favour of your company has been much felt        i assure you  we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our       humble abode  our plain manner of living  our small rooms and few       domestics  and the little we see of the world  must make hunsford       extremely dull to a young lady like yourself  but i hope you will       believe us grateful for the condescension  and that we have done       everything in our power to prevent your spending your time       unpleasantly          elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness        she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment  and the pleasure of       being with charlotte  and the kind attentions she had received        must make her feel the obliged  mr  collins was gratified  and       with a more smiling solemnity replied          it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your       time not disagreeably  we have certainly done our best  and most       fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very       superior society  and  from our connection with rosings  the       frequent means of varying the humble home scene  i think we may       flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been       entirely irksome  our situation with regard to lady catherine s       family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing       which few can boast  you see on what a footing we are  you see       how continually we are engaged there  in truth i must acknowledge       that  with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage  i       should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion        while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings          words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings  and he       was obliged to walk about the room  while elizabeth tried to       unite civility and truth in a few short sentences          you may  in fact  carry a very favourable report of us into       hertfordshire  my dear cousin  i flatter myself at least that you       will be able to do so  lady catherine s great attentions to mrs        collins you have been a daily witness of  and altogether i trust       it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but       on this point it will be as well to be silent  only let me assure       you  my dear miss elizabeth  that i can from my heart most       cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage  my dear charlotte       and i have but one mind and one way of thinking  there is in       everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas       between us  we seem to have been designed for each other          elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where       that was the case  and with equal sincerity could add  that she       firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts  she was       not sorry  however  to have the recital of them interrupted by       the lady from whom they sprang  poor charlotte  it was melancholy       to leave her to such society  but she had chosen it with her eyes       open  and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to       go  she did not seem to ask for compassion  her home and her       housekeeping  her parish and her poultry  and all their dependent       concerns  had not yet lost their charms         at length the chaise arrived  the trunks were fastened on  the       parcels placed within  and it was pronounced to be ready  after       an affectionate parting between the friends  elizabeth was       attended to the carriage by mr  collins  and as they walked down       the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all       her family  not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had       received at longbourn in the winter  and his compliments to mr        and mrs  gardiner  though unknown  he then handed her in  maria       followed  and the door was on the point of being closed  when he       suddenly reminded them  with some consternation  that they had       hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at       rosings          but   he added   you will of course wish to have your humble       respects delivered to them  with your grateful thanks for their       kindness to you while you have been here          elizabeth made no objection  the door was then allowed to be       shut  and the carriage drove off          good gracious   cried maria  after a few minutes  silence   it       seems but a day or two since we first came  and yet how many       things have happened           a great many indeed   said her companion with a sigh          we have dined nine times at rosings  besides drinking tea there       twice  how much i shall have to tell          elizabeth added privately   and how much i shall have to       conceal          their journey was performed without much conversation  or any       alarm  and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they       reached mr  gardiner s house  where they were to remain a few       days         jane looked well  and elizabeth had little opportunity of       studying her spirits  amidst the various engagements which the       kindness of her aunt had reserved for them  but jane was to go       home with her  and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for       observation         it was not without an effort  meanwhile  that she could wait even       for longbourn  before she told her sister of mr  darcy s       proposals  to know that she had the power of revealing what would       so exceedingly astonish jane  and must  at the same time  so       highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been       able to reason away  was such a temptation to openness as nothing       could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she       remained as to the extent of what she should communicate  and her       fear  if she once entered on the subject  of being hurried into       repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister       further              it was the second week in may  in which the three young ladies       set out together from gracechurch street for the town of     in       hertfordshire  and  as they drew near the appointed inn where mr        bennet s carriage was to meet them  they quickly perceived  in       token of the coachman s punctuality  both kitty and lydia looking       out of a dining room up stairs  these two girls had been above an       hour in the place  happily employed in visiting an opposite       milliner  watching the sentinel on guard  and dressing a salad       and cucumber         after welcoming their sisters  they triumphantly displayed a       table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually       affords  exclaiming   is not this nice  is not this an agreeable       surprise           and we mean to treat you all   added lydia   but you must lend       us the money  for we have just spent ours at the shop out there         then  showing her purchases  look here  i have bought this       bonnet  i do not think it is very pretty  but i thought i might       as well buy it as not  i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get       home  and see if i can make it up any better          and when her sisters abused it as ugly  she added  with perfect       unconcern   oh  but there were two or three much uglier in the       shop  and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim       it with fresh  i think it will be very tolerable  besides  it       will not much signify what one wears this summer  after the         shire have left meryton  and they are going in a fortnight           are they indeed   cried elizabeth  with the greatest       satisfaction          they are going to be encamped near brighton  and i do so want       papa to take us all there for the summer  it would be such a       delicious scheme  and i dare say would hardly cost anything at       all  mamma would like to go too of all things  only think what a       miserable summer else we shall have           yes   thought elizabeth   that would be a delightful scheme       indeed  and completely do for us at once  good heaven  brighton        and a whole campful of soldiers  to us  who have been overset       already by one poor regiment of militia  and the monthly balls of       meryton           now i have got some news for you   said lydia  as they sat down       at table   what do you think  it is excellent news capital       news and about a certain person we all like          jane and elizabeth looked at each other  and the waiter was told       he need not stay  lydia laughed  and said          aye  that is just like your formality and discretion  you       thought the waiter must not hear  as if he cared  i dare say he       often hears worse things said than i am going to say  but he is       an ugly fellow  i am glad he is gone  i never saw such a long       chin in my life  well  but now for my news  it is about dear       wickham  too good for the waiter  is it not  there is no danger       of wickham s marrying mary king  there s for you  she is gone       down to her uncle at liverpool  gone to stay  wickham is safe           and mary king is safe   added elizabeth   safe from a connection       imprudent as to fortune           she is a great fool for going away  if she liked him           but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side   said       jane          i am sure there is not on his  i will answer for it  he never       cared three straws about her who could about such a nasty       little freckled thing          elizabeth was shocked to think that  however incapable of such       coarseness of expression herself  the coarseness of the       sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured       and fancied liberal         as soon as all had ate  and the elder ones paid  the carriage was       ordered  and after some contrivance  the whole party  with all       their boxes  work bags  and parcels  and the unwelcome addition       of kitty s and lydia s purchases  were seated in it          how nicely we are all crammed in   cried lydia   i am glad i       bought my bonnet  if it is only for the fun of having another       bandbox  well  now let us be quite comfortable and snug  and talk       and laugh all the way home  and in the first place  let us hear       what has happened to you all since you went away  have you seen       any pleasant men  have you had any flirting  i was in great hopes       that one of you would have got a husband before you came back        jane will be quite an old maid soon  i declare  she is almost       three and twenty  lord  how ashamed i should be of not being       married before three and twenty  my aunt phillips wants you so to       get husbands  you can t think  she says lizzy had better have       taken mr  collins  but i do not think there would have been any       fun in it  lord  how i should like to be married before any of       you  and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls  dear       me  we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel       forster s  kitty and me were to spend the day there  and mrs        forster promised to have a little dance in the evening   by the       bye  mrs  forster and me are such friends   and so she asked       the two harringtons to come  but harriet was ill  and so pen was       forced to come by herself  and then  what do you think we did  we       dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for       a lady  only think what fun  not a soul knew of it  but colonel       and mrs  forster  and kitty and me  except my aunt  for we were       forced to borrow one of her gowns  and you cannot imagine how       well he looked  when denny  and wickham  and pratt  and two or       three more of the men came in  they did not know him in the       least  lord  how i laughed  and so did mrs  forster  i thought i       should have died  and that made the men suspect something  and       then they soon found out what was the matter          with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes  did       lydia  assisted by kitty s hints and additions  endeavour to       amuse her companions all the way to longbourn  elizabeth listened       as little as she could  but there was no escaping the frequent       mention of wickham s name         their reception at home was most kind  mrs  bennet rejoiced to       see jane in undiminished beauty  and more than once during dinner       did mr  bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth          i am glad you are come back  lizzy          their party in the dining room was large  for almost all the       lucases came to meet maria and hear the news  and various were       the subjects that occupied them  lady lucas was enquiring of       maria  after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter  mrs        bennet was doubly engaged  on one hand collecting an account of       the present fashions from jane  who sat some way below her  and        on the other  retailing them all to the younger lucases  and       lydia  in a voice rather louder than any other person s  was       enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who       would hear her          oh  mary   said she   i wish you had gone with us  for we had       such fun  as we went along  kitty and i drew up the blinds  and       pretended there was nobody in the coach  and i should have gone       so all the way  if kitty had not been sick  and when we got to       the george  i do think we behaved very handsomely  for we treated       the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world  and       if you would have gone  we would have treated you too  and then       when we came away it was such fun  i thought we never should have       got into the coach  i was ready to die of laughter  and then we       were so merry all the way home  we talked and laughed so loud        that anybody might have heard us ten miles off          to this mary very gravely replied   far be it from me  my dear       sister  to depreciate such pleasures  they would doubtless be       congenial with the generality of female minds  but i confess they       would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book          but of this answer lydia heard not a word  she seldom listened to       anybody for more than half a minute  and never attended to mary       at all         in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to       walk to meryton  and to see how everybody went on  but elizabeth       steadily opposed the scheme  it should not be said that the miss       bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in       pursuit of the officers  there was another reason too for her       opposition  she dreaded seeing mr  wickham again  and was       resolved to avoid it as long as possible  the comfort to her of       the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression        in a fortnight they were to go and once gone  she hoped there       could be nothing more to plague her on his account         she had not been many hours at home before she found that the       brighton scheme  of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn        was under frequent discussion between her parents  elizabeth saw       directly that her father had not the smallest intention of       yielding  but his answers were at the same time so vague and       equivocal  that her mother  though often disheartened  had never       yet despaired of succeeding at last              elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened       could no longer be overcome  and at length  resolving to suppress       every particular in which her sister was concerned  and preparing       her to be surprised  she related to her the next morning the       chief of the scene between mr  darcy and herself         miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong       sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear       perfectly natural  and all surprise was shortly lost in other       feelings  she was sorry that mr  darcy should have delivered his       sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them  but       still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s       refusal must have given him          his being so sure of succeeding was wrong   said she   and       certainly ought not to have appeared  but consider how much it       must increase his disappointment           indeed   replied elizabeth   i am heartily sorry for him  but he       has other feelings  which will probably soon drive away his       regard for me  you do not blame me  however  for refusing him           blame you  oh  no           but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham           no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did           but you will know it  when i tell you what happened the very       next day          she then spoke of the letter  repeating the whole of its contents       as far as they concerned george wickham  what a stroke was this       for poor jane  who would willingly have gone through the world       without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole       race of mankind  as was here collected in one individual  nor was       darcy s vindication  though grateful to her feelings  capable of       consoling her for such discovery  most earnestly did she labour       to prove the probability of error  and seek to clear the one       without involving the other          this will not do   said elizabeth   you never will be able to       make both of them good for anything  take your choice  but you       must be satisfied with only one  there is but such a quantity of       merit between them  just enough to make one good sort of man  and       of late it has been shifting about pretty much  for my part  i am       inclined to believe it all darcy s  but you shall do as you       choose          it was some time  however  before a smile could be extorted from       jane          i do not know when i have been more shocked   said she   wickham       so very bad  it is almost past belief  and poor mr  darcy  dear       lizzy  only consider what he must have suffered  such a       disappointment  and with the knowledge of your ill opinion  too        and having to relate such a thing of his sister  it is really too       distressing  i am sure you must feel it so           oh  no  my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you       so full of both  i know you will do him such ample justice  that       i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent  your       profusion makes me saving  and if you lament over him much       longer  my heart will be as light as a feather           poor wickham  there is such an expression of goodness in his       countenance  such an openness and gentleness in his manner           there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of       those two young men  one has got all the goodness  and the other       all the appearance of it           i never thought mr  darcy so deficient in the appearance of it       as you used to do           and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a       dislike to him  without any reason  it is such a spur to one s       genius  such an opening for wit  to have a dislike of that kind        one may be continually abusive without saying anything just  but       one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then       stumbling on something witty           lizzy  when you first read that letter  i am sure you could not       treat the matter as you do now           indeed  i could not  i was uncomfortable enough  i may say       unhappy  and with no one to speak to about what i felt  no jane       to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain       and nonsensical as i knew i had  oh  how i wanted you           how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong       expressions in speaking of wickham to mr  darcy  for now they       do appear wholly undeserved           certainly  but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a       most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been       encouraging  there is one point on which i want your advice  i       want to be told whether i ought  or ought not  to make our       acquaintances in general understand wickham s character          miss bennet paused a little  and then replied   surely there can       be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully  what is your       opinion           that it ought not to be attempted  mr  darcy has not authorised       me to make his communication public  on the contrary  every       particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as       possible to myself  and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to       the rest of his conduct  who will believe me  the general       prejudice against mr  darcy is so violent  that it would be the       death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him       in an amiable light  i am not equal to it  wickham will soon be       gone  and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he       really is  some time hence it will be all found out  and then we       may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before  at present       i will say nothing about it           you are quite right  to have his errors made public might ruin       him for ever  he is now  perhaps  sorry for what he has done  and       anxious to re establish a character  we must not make him       desperate          the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation        she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her       for a fortnight  and was certain of a willing listener in jane        whenever she might wish to talk again of either  but there was       still something lurking behind  of which prudence forbade the       disclosure  she dared not relate the other half of mr  darcy s       letter  nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been       valued by her friend  here was knowledge in which no one could       partake  and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect       understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing       off this last encumbrance of mystery   and then   said she   if       that very improbable event should ever take place  i shall merely       be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable       manner himself  the liberty of communication cannot be mine till       it has lost all its value          she was now  on being settled at home  at leisure to observe the       real state of her sister s spirits  jane was not happy  she still       cherished a very tender affection for bingley  having never even       fancied herself in love before  her regard had all the warmth of       first attachment  and  from her age and disposition  greater       steadiness than most first attachments often boast  and so       fervently did she value his remembrance  and prefer him to every       other man  that all her good sense  and all her attention to the       feelings of her friends  were requisite to check the indulgence       of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health       and their tranquillity          well  lizzy   said mrs  bennet one day   what is your opinion       now of this sad business of jane s  for my part  i am       determined never to speak of it again to anybody  i told my       sister phillips so the other day  but i cannot find out that jane       saw anything of him in london  well  he is a very undeserving       young man and i do not suppose there s the least chance in the       world of her ever getting him now  there is no talk of his coming       to netherfield again in the summer  and i have enquired of       everybody  too  who is likely to know           i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more           oh well  it is just as he chooses  nobody wants him to come        though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill  and       if i was her  i would not have put up with it  well  my comfort       is  i am sure jane will die of a broken heart  and then he will       be sorry for what he has done          but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such       expectation  she made no answer          well  lizzy   continued her mother  soon afterwards   and so the       collinses live very comfortable  do they  well  well  i only hope       it will last  and what sort of table do they keep  charlotte is       an excellent manager  i dare say  if she is half as sharp as her       mother  she is saving enough  there is nothing extravagant in       their housekeeping  i dare say           no  nothing at all           a great deal of good management  depend upon it  yes  yes        they will take care not to outrun their income  they will       never be distressed for money  well  much good may it do them        and so  i suppose  they often talk of having longbourn when your       father is dead  they look upon it as quite their own  i dare say        whenever that happens           it was a subject which they could not mention before me           no  it would have been strange if they had  but i make no doubt       they often talk of it between themselves  well  if they can be       easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own  so much the       better  i should be ashamed of having one that was only       entailed on me               the first week of their return was soon gone  the second began        it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton  and all the       young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace  the       dejection was almost universal  the elder miss bennets alone were       still able to eat  drink  and sleep  and pursue the usual course       of their employments  very frequently were they reproached for       this insensibility by kitty and lydia  whose own misery was       extreme  and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in       any of the family          good heaven  what is to become of us  what are we to do   would       they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe   how can you be       smiling so  lizzy          their affectionate mother shared all their grief  she remembered       what she had herself endured on a similar occasion        five and twenty years ago          i am sure   said she   i cried for two days together when       colonel miller s regiment went away  i thought i should have       broken my heart           i am sure i shall break mine   said lydia          if one could but go to brighton   observed mrs  bennet          oh  yes  if one could but go to brighton  but papa is so       disagreeable           a little sea bathing would set me up forever           and my aunt phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of       good   added kitty         such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through       longbourn house  elizabeth tried to be diverted by them  but all       sense of pleasure was lost in shame  she felt anew the justice of       mr  darcy s objections  and never had she been so much disposed       to pardon his interference in the views of his friend         but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away  for       she received an invitation from mrs  forster  the wife of the       colonel of the regiment  to accompany her to brighton  this       invaluable friend was a very young woman  and very lately       married  a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had       recommended her and lydia to each other  and out of their three       months  acquaintance they had been intimate two         the rapture of lydia on this occasion  her adoration of mrs        forster  the delight of mrs  bennet  and the mortification of       kitty  are scarcely to be described  wholly inattentive to her       sister s feelings  lydia flew about the house in restless       ecstasy  calling for everyone s congratulations  and laughing and       talking with more violence than ever  whilst the luckless kitty       continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as       unreasonable as her accent was peevish          i cannot see why mrs  forster should not ask me as well as       lydia   said she   though i am not her particular friend  i       have just as much right to be asked as she has  and more too  for       i am two years older          in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable  and jane to       make her resigned  as for elizabeth herself  this invitation was       so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother       and lydia  that she considered it as the death warrant of all       possibility of common sense for the latter  and detestable as       such a step must make her were it known  she could not help       secretly advising her father not to let her go  she represented       to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour  the       little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a       woman as mrs  forster  and the probability of her being yet more       imprudent with such a companion at brighton  where the       temptations must be greater than at home  he heard her       attentively  and then said          lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some       public place or other  and we can never expect her to do it with       so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the       present circumstances           if you were aware   said elizabeth   of the very great       disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of       lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay  which has already       arisen from it  i am sure you would judge differently in the       affair           already arisen   repeated mr  bennet   what  has she frightened       away some of your lovers  poor little lizzy  but do not be cast       down  such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a       little absurdity are not worth a regret  come  let me see the       list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s       folly           indeed you are mistaken  i have no such injuries to resent  it       is not of particular  but of general evils  which i am now       complaining  our importance  our respectability in the world must       be affected by the wild volatility  the assurance and disdain of       all restraint which mark lydia s character  excuse me  for i must       speak plainly  if you  my dear father  will not take the trouble       of checking her exuberant spirits  and of teaching her that her       present pursuits are not to be the business of her life  she will       soon be beyond the reach of amendment  her character will be       fixed  and she will  at sixteen  be the most determined flirt       that ever made herself or her family ridiculous  a flirt  too  in       the worst and meanest degree of flirtation  without any       attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person  and  from the       ignorance and emptiness of her mind  wholly unable to ward off       any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for       admiration will excite  in this danger kitty also is       comprehended  she will follow wherever lydia leads  vain        ignorant  idle  and absolutely uncontrolled  oh  my dear father        can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and       despised wherever they are known  and that their sisters will not       be often involved in the disgrace          mr  bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject  and       affectionately taking her hand said in reply          do not make yourself uneasy  my love  wherever you and jane are       known you must be respected and valued  and you will not appear       to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say  three very       silly sisters  we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does       not go to brighton  let her go  then  colonel forster is a       sensible man  and will keep her out of any real mischief  and she       is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody  at       brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt       than she has been here  the officers will find women better worth       their notice  let us hope  therefore  that her being there may       teach her her own insignificance  at any rate  she cannot grow       many degrees worse  without authorising us to lock her up for the       rest of her life          with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content  but her own       opinion continued the same  and she left him disappointed and       sorry  it was not in her nature  however  to increase her       vexations by dwelling on them  she was confident of having       performed her duty  and to fret over unavoidable evils  or       augment them by anxiety  was no part of her disposition         had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference       with her father  their indignation would hardly have found       expression in their united volubility  in lydia s imagination  a       visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly       happiness  she saw  with the creative eye of fancy  the streets       of that gay bathing place covered with officers  she saw herself       the object of attention  to tens and to scores of them at present       unknown  she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched       forth in beauteous uniformity of lines  crowded with the young       and the gay  and dazzling with scarlet  and  to complete the       view  she saw herself seated beneath a tent  tenderly flirting       with at least six officers at once         had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects       and such realities as these  what would have been her sensations        they could have been understood only by her mother  who might       have felt nearly the same  lydia s going to brighton was all that       consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband s never       intending to go there himself         but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed  and their       raptures continued  with little intermission  to the very day of       lydia s leaving home         elizabeth was now to see mr  wickham for the last time  having       been frequently in company with him since her return  agitation       was pretty well over  the agitations of former partiality       entirely so  she had even learnt to detect  in the very       gentleness which had first delighted her  an affectation and a       sameness to disgust and weary  in his present behaviour to       herself  moreover  she had a fresh source of displeasure  for the       inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which       had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve        after what had since passed  to provoke her  she lost all concern       for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such       idle and frivolous gallantry  and while she steadily repressed       it  could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing        that however long  and for whatever cause  his attentions had       been withdrawn  her vanity would be gratified  and her preference       secured at any time by their renewal         on the very last day of the regiment s remaining at meryton  he       dined  with others of the officers  at longbourn  and so little       was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour  that on       his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had       passed at hunsford  she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and mr        darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings  and asked him        if he was acquainted with the former         he looked surprised  displeased  alarmed  but with a moment s       recollection and a returning smile  replied  that he had formerly       seen him often  and  after observing that he was a very       gentlemanlike man  asked her how she had liked him  her answer       was warmly in his favour  with an air of indifference he soon       afterwards added          how long did you say he was at rosings           nearly three weeks           and you saw him frequently           yes  almost every day           his manners are very different from his cousin s           yes  very different  but i think mr  darcy improves upon       acquaintance           indeed   cried mr  wickham with a look which did not escape her         and pray  may i ask    but checking himself  he added  in a       gayer tone   is it in address that he improves  has he deigned to       add aught of civility to his ordinary style  for i dare not       hope   he continued in a lower and more serious tone   that he is       improved in essentials           oh  no   said elizabeth   in essentials  i believe  he is very       much what he ever was          while she spoke  wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to       rejoice over her words  or to distrust their meaning  there was a       something in her countenance which made him listen with an       apprehensive and anxious attention  while she added          when i said that he improved on acquaintance  i did not mean       that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement  but       that  from knowing him better  his disposition was better       understood          wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and       agitated look  for a few minutes he was silent  till  shaking off       his embarrassment  he turned to her again  and said in the       gentlest of accents          you  who so well know my feeling towards mr  darcy  will readily       comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to       assume even the appearance of what is right  his pride  in that       direction  may be of service  if not to himself  to many others        for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have       suffered by  i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which       you  i imagine  have been alluding  is merely adopted on his       visits to his aunt  of whose good opinion and judgement he stands       much in awe  his fear of her has always operated  i know  when       they were together  and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish       of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh  which i am certain       he has very much at heart          elizabeth could not repress a smile at this  but she answered       only by a slight inclination of the head  she saw that he wanted       to engage her on the old subject of his grievances  and she was       in no humour to indulge him  the rest of the evening passed with       the appearance  on his side  of usual cheerfulness  but with no       further attempt to distinguish elizabeth  and they parted at last       with mutual civility  and possibly a mutual desire of never       meeting again         when the party broke up  lydia returned with mrs  forster to       meryton  from whence they were to set out early the next morning        the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than       pathetic  kitty was the only one who shed tears  but she did weep       from vexation and envy  mrs  bennet was diffuse in her good       wishes for the felicity of her daughter  and impressive in her       injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying       herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason       to believe would be well attended to  and in the clamorous       happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell  the more gentle       adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard              had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family  she       could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal       felicity or domestic comfort  her father  captivated by youth and       beauty  and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty       generally give  had married a woman whose weak understanding and       illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all       real affection for her  respect  esteem  and confidence had       vanished for ever  and all his views of domestic happiness were       overthrown  but mr  bennet was not of a disposition to seek       comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had       brought on  in any of those pleasures which too often console the       unfortunate for their folly or their vice  he was fond of the       country and of books  and from these tastes had arisen his       principal enjoyments  to his wife he was very little otherwise       indebted  than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his       amusement  this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in       general wish to owe to his wife  but where other powers of       entertainment are wanting  the true philosopher will derive       benefit from such as are given         elizabeth  however  had never been blind to the impropriety of       her father s behaviour as a husband  she had always seen it with       pain  but respecting his abilities  and grateful for his       affectionate treatment of herself  she endeavoured to forget what       she could not overlook  and to banish from her thoughts that       continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which  in       exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children  was so       highly reprehensible  but she had never felt so strongly as now       the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable       a marriage  nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising       from so ill judged a direction of talents  talents  which        rightly used  might at least have preserved the respectability of       his daughters  even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his       wife         when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure she found       little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment        their parties abroad were less varied than before  and at home       she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the       dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their       domestic circle  and  though kitty might in time regain her       natural degree of sense  since the disturbers of her brain were       removed  her other sister  from whose disposition greater evil       might be apprehended  was likely to be hardened in all her folly       and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a       watering place and a camp  upon the whole  therefore  she found        what has been sometimes found before  that an event to which she       had looked forward with impatient desire did not  in taking       place  bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself  it       was consequently necessary to name some other period for the       commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which       her wishes and hopes might be fixed  and by again enjoying the       pleasure of anticipation  console herself for the present  and       prepare for another disappointment  her tour to the lakes was now       the object of her happiest thoughts  it was her best consolation       for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her       mother and kitty made inevitable  and could she have included       jane in the scheme  every part of it would have been perfect          but it is fortunate   thought she   that i have something to       wish for  were the whole arrangement complete  my disappointment       would be certain  but here  by carrying with me one ceaseless       source of regret in my sister s absence  i may reasonably hope to       have all my expectations of pleasure realised  a scheme of which       every part promises delight can never be successful  and general       disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little       peculiar vexation          when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very       minutely to her mother and kitty  but her letters were always       long expected  and always very short  those to her mother       contained little else than that they were just returned from the       library  where such and such officers had attended them  and       where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite       wild  that she had a new gown  or a new parasol  which she would       have described more fully  but was obliged to leave off in a       violent hurry  as mrs  forster called her  and they were going       off to the camp  and from her correspondence with her sister        there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty        though rather longer  were much too full of lines under the words       to be made public         after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence  health        good humour  and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn        everything wore a happier aspect  the families who had been in       town for the winter came back again  and summer finery and summer       engagements arose  mrs  bennet was restored to her usual       querulous serenity  and  by the middle of june  kitty was so much       recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears  an event       of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the       following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not       to mention an officer above once a day  unless  by some cruel and       malicious arrangement at the war office  another regiment should       be quartered in meryton         the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now       fast approaching  and a fortnight only was wanting of it  when a       letter arrived from mrs  gardiner  which at once delayed its       commencement and curtailed its extent  mr  gardiner would be       prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in       july  and must be in london again within a month  and as that       left too short a period for them to go so far  and see so much as       they had proposed  or at least to see it with the leisure and       comfort they had built on  they were obliged to give up the       lakes  and substitute a more contracted tour  and  according to       the present plan  were to go no farther northwards than       derbyshire  in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy       the chief of their three weeks  and to mrs  gardiner it had a       peculiarly strong attraction  the town where she had formerly       passed some years of her life  and where they were now to spend a       few days  was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all       the celebrated beauties of matlock  chatsworth  dovedale  or the       peak         elizabeth was excessively disappointed  she had set her heart on       seeing the lakes  and still thought there might have been time       enough  but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her       temper to be happy  and all was soon right again         with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected        it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of       pemberley and its owner   but surely   said she   i may enter his       county with impunity  and rob it of a few petrified spars without       his perceiving me          the period of expectation was now doubled  four weeks were to       pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival  but they did pass       away  and mr  and mrs  gardiner  with their four children  did at       length appear at longbourn  the children  two girls of six and       eight years old  and two younger boys  were to be left under the       particular care of their cousin jane  who was the general       favourite  and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly       adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them        playing with them  and loving them         the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn  and set off the       next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement        one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness of companions  a       suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear       inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and       affection and intelligence  which might supply it among       themselves if there were disappointments abroad         it is not the object of this work to give a description of       derbyshire  nor of any of the remarkable places through which       their route thither lay  oxford  blenheim  warwick  kenilworth        birmingham  etc  are sufficiently known  a small part of       derbyshire is all the present concern  to the little town of       lambton  the scene of mrs  gardiner s former residence  and where       she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained  they       bent their steps  after having seen all the principal wonders of       the country  and within five miles of lambton  elizabeth found       from her aunt that pemberley was situated  it was not in their       direct road  nor more than a mile or two out of it  in talking       over their route the evening before  mrs  gardiner expressed an       inclination to see the place again  mr  gardiner declared his       willingness  and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation          my love  should not you like to see a place of which you have       heard so much   said her aunt   a place  too  with which so many       of your acquaintances are connected  wickham passed all his youth       there  you know          elizabeth was distressed  she felt that she had no business at       pemberley  and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing       it  she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses  after       going over so many  she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or       satin curtains         mrs  gardiner abused her stupidity   if it were merely a fine       house richly furnished   said she   i should not care about it       myself  but the grounds are delightful  they have some of the       finest woods in the country          elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce  the       possibility of meeting mr  darcy  while viewing the place        instantly occurred  it would be dreadful  she blushed at the very       idea  and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt       than to run such a risk  but against this there were objections        and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource  if       her private enquiries to the absence of the family were       unfavourably answered         accordingly  when she retired at night  she asked the chambermaid       whether pemberley were not a very fine place  what was the name       of its proprietor  and  with no little alarm  whether the family       were down for the summer  a most welcome negative followed the       last question and her alarms now being removed  she was at       leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house       herself  and when the subject was revived the next morning  and       she was again applied to  could readily answer  and with a proper       air of indifference  that she had not really any dislike to the       scheme  to pemberley  therefore  they were to go              elizabeth  as they drove along  watched for the first appearance       of pemberley woods with some perturbation  and when at length       they turned in at the lodge  her spirits were in a high flutter         the park was very large  and contained great variety of ground        they entered it in one of its lowest points  and drove for some       time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent         elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation  but she saw and       admired every remarkable spot and point of view  they gradually       ascended for half a mile  and then found themselves at the top of       a considerable eminence  where the wood ceased  and the eye was       instantly caught by pemberley house  situated on the opposite       side of a valley  into which the road with some abruptness wound        it was a large  handsome stone building  standing well on rising       ground  and backed by a ridge of high woody hills  and in front        a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater  but       without any artificial appearance  its banks were neither formal       nor falsely adorned  elizabeth was delighted  she had never seen       a place for which nature had done more  or where natural beauty       had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste  they were       all of them warm in their admiration  and at that moment she felt       that to be mistress of pemberley might be something         they descended the hill  crossed the bridge  and drove to the       door  and  while examining the nearer aspect of the house  all       her apprehension of meeting its owner returned  she dreaded lest       the chambermaid had been mistaken  on applying to see the place        they were admitted into the hall  and elizabeth  as they waited       for the housekeeper  had leisure to wonder at her being where she       was         the housekeeper came  a respectable looking elderly woman  much       less fine  and more civil  than she had any notion of finding       her  they followed her into the dining parlour  it was a large        well proportioned room  handsomely fitted up  elizabeth  after       slightly surveying it  went to a window to enjoy its prospect        the hill  crowned with wood  which they had descended  receiving       increased abruptness from the distance  was a beautiful object        every disposition of the ground was good  and she looked on the       whole scene  the river  the trees scattered on its banks and the       winding of the valley  as far as she could trace it  with       delight  as they passed into other rooms these objects were       taking different positions  but from every window there were       beauties to be seen  the rooms were lofty and handsome  and their       furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor  but       elizabeth saw  with admiration of his taste  that it was neither       gaudy nor uselessly fine  with less of splendour  and more real       elegance  than the furniture of rosings          and of this place   thought she   i might have been mistress        with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted        instead of viewing them as a stranger  i might have rejoiced in       them as my own  and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and       aunt  but no   recollecting herself  that could never be  my       uncle and aunt would have been lost to me  i should not have been       allowed to invite them          this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something very       like regret         she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was       really absent  but had not the courage for it  at length however        the question was asked by her uncle  and she turned away with       alarm  while mrs  reynolds replied that he was  adding   but we       expect him to morrow  with a large party of friends   how       rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any       circumstance been delayed a day         her aunt now called her to look at a picture  she approached and       saw the likeness of mr  wickham  suspended  amongst several other       miniatures  over the mantelpiece  her aunt asked her  smilingly        how she liked it  the housekeeper came forward  and told them it       was a picture of a young gentleman  the son of her late master s       steward  who had been brought up by him at his own expense   he       is now gone into the army   she added   but i am afraid he has       turned out very wild          mrs  gardiner looked at her niece with a smile  but elizabeth       could not return it          and that   said mrs  reynolds  pointing to another of the       miniatures   is my master and very like him  it was drawn at the       same time as the other about eight years ago           i have heard much of your master s fine person   said mrs        gardiner  looking at the picture   it is a handsome face  but        lizzy  you can tell us whether it is like or not          mrs  reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this       intimation of her knowing her master          does that young lady know mr  darcy          elizabeth coloured  and said   a little           and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman  ma am           yes  very handsome           i am sure i know none so handsome  but in the gallery up       stairs you will see a finer  larger picture of him than this        this room was my late master s favourite room  and these       miniatures are just as they used to be then  he was very fond of       them          this accounted to elizabeth for mr  wickham s being among them         mrs  reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy        drawn when she was only eight years old          and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother   said mrs        gardiner          oh  yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen  and so       accomplished  she plays and sings all day long  in the next room       is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my       master  she comes here to morrow with him          mr  gardiner  whose manners were very easy and pleasant        encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks        mrs  reynolds  either by pride or attachment  had evidently great       pleasure in talking of her master and his sister          is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year           not so much as i could wish  sir  but i dare say he may spend       half his time here  and miss darcy is always down for the summer       months           except   thought elizabeth   when she goes to ramsgate           if your master would marry  you might see more of him           yes  sir  but i do not know when that will be  i do not know       who is good enough for him          mr  and mrs  gardiner smiled  elizabeth could not help saying         it is very much to his credit  i am sure  that you should think       so           i say no more than the truth  and everybody will say that knows       him   replied the other  elizabeth thought this was going pretty       far  and she listened with increasing astonishment as the       housekeeper added   i have never known a cross word from him in       my life  and i have known him ever since he was four years old          this was praise  of all others most extraordinary  most opposite       to her ideas  that he was not a good tempered man had been her       firmest opinion  her keenest attention was awakened  she longed       to hear more  and was grateful to her uncle for saying          there are very few people of whom so much can be said  you are       lucky in having such a master           yes  sir  i know i am  if i were to go through the world  i       could not meet with a better  but i have always observed  that       they who are good natured when children  are good natured when       they grow up  and he was always the sweetest tempered  most       generous hearted boy in the world          elizabeth almost stared at her   can this be mr  darcy   thought       she          his father was an excellent man   said mrs  gardiner          yes  ma am  that he was indeed  and his son will be just like       him just as affable to the poor          elizabeth listened  wondered  doubted  and was impatient for       more  mrs  reynolds could interest her on no other point  she       related the subjects of the pictures  the dimensions of the       rooms  and the price of the furniture  in vain  mr  gardiner        highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he       attributed her excessive commendation of her master  soon led       again to the subject  and she dwelt with energy on his many       merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase          he is the best landlord  and the best master   said she   that       ever lived  not like the wild young men nowadays  who think of       nothing but themselves  there is not one of his tenants or       servants but will give him a good name  some people call him       proud  but i am sure i never saw anything of it  to my fancy  it       is only because he does not rattle away like other young men           in what an amiable light does this place him   thought       elizabeth          this fine account of him   whispered her aunt as they walked         is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend           perhaps we might be deceived           that is not very likely  our authority was too good          on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very       pretty sitting room  lately fitted up with greater elegance and       lightness than the apartments below  and were informed that it       was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy  who had taken a       liking to the room when last at pemberley          he is certainly a good brother   said elizabeth  as she walked       towards one of the windows         mrs  reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight  when she should       enter the room   and this is always the way with him   she added         whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in       a moment  there is nothing he would not do for her          the picture gallery  and two or three of the principal bedrooms        were all that remained to be shown  in the former were many good       paintings  but elizabeth knew nothing of the art  and from such       as had been already visible below  she had willingly turned to       look at some drawings of miss darcy s  in crayons  whose subjects       were usually more interesting  and also more intelligible         in the gallery there were many family portraits  but they could       have little to fix the attention of a stranger  elizabeth walked       in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her        at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance to       mr  darcy  with such a smile over the face as she remembered to       have sometimes seen when he looked at her  she stood several       minutes before the picture  in earnest contemplation  and       returned to it again before they quitted the gallery  mrs        reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s       lifetime         there was certainly at this moment  in elizabeth s mind  a more       gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at       the height of their acquaintance  the commendation bestowed on       him by mrs  reynolds was of no trifling nature  what praise is       more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant  as a       brother  a landlord  a master  she considered how many people s       happiness were in his guardianship  how much of pleasure or pain       was it in his power to bestow  how much of good or evil must be       done by him  every idea that had been brought forward by the       housekeeper was favourable to his character  and as she stood       before the canvas on which he was represented  and fixed his eyes       upon herself  she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment       of gratitude than it had ever raised before  she remembered its       warmth  and softened its impropriety of expression         when all of the house that was open to general inspection had       been seen  they returned downstairs  and  taking leave of the       housekeeper  were consigned over to the gardener  who met them at       the hall door         as they walked across the hall towards the river  elizabeth       turned back to look again  her uncle and aunt stopped also  and       while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building        the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road        which led behind it to the stables         they were within twenty yards of each other  and so abrupt was       his appearance  that it was impossible to avoid his sight  their       eyes instantly met  and the cheeks of both were overspread with       the deepest blush  he absolutely started  and for a moment seemed       immovable from surprise  but shortly recovering himself  advanced       towards the party  and spoke to elizabeth  if not in terms of       perfect composure  at least of perfect civility         she had instinctively turned away  but stopping on his approach        received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be       overcome  had his first appearance  or his resemblance to the       picture they had just been examining  been insufficient to assure       the other two that they now saw mr  darcy  the gardener s       expression of surprise  on beholding his master  must immediately       have told it  they stood a little aloof while he was talking to       their niece  who  astonished and confused  scarcely dared lift       her eyes to his face  and knew not what answer she returned to       his civil enquiries after her family  amazed at the alteration of       his manner since they last parted  every sentence that he uttered       was increasing her embarrassment  and every idea of the       impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind  the       few minutes in which they continued were some of the most       uncomfortable in her life  nor did he seem much more at ease        when he spoke  his accent had none of its usual sedateness  and       he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left       longbourn  and of her stay in derbyshire  so often  and in so       hurried a way  as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts         at length every idea seemed to fail him  and  after standing a       few moments without saying a word  he suddenly recollected       himself  and took leave         the others then joined her  and expressed admiration of his       figure  but elizabeth heard not a word  and wholly engrossed by       her own feelings  followed them in silence  she was overpowered       by shame and vexation  her coming there was the most unfortunate        the most ill judged thing in the world  how strange it must       appear to him  in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so       vain a man  it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself       in his way again  oh  why did she come  or  why did he thus come       a day before he was expected  had they been only ten minutes       sooner  they should have been beyond the reach of his       discrimination  for it was plain that he was that moment       arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage  she       blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting  and       his behaviour  so strikingly altered what could it mean  that he       should even speak to her was amazing  but to speak with such       civility  to enquire after her family  never in her life had she       seen his manners so little dignified  never had he spoken with       such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting  what a contrast       did it offer to his last address in rosings park  when he put his       letter into her hand  she knew not what to think  or how to       account for it         they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water        and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground  or a       finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching  but it       was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it  and        though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her       uncle and aunt  and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as       they pointed out  she distinguished no part of the scene  her       thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house        whichever it might be  where mr  darcy then was  she longed to       know what at the moment was passing in his mind in what manner he       thought of her  and whether  in defiance of everything  she was       still dear to him  perhaps he had been civil only because he felt       himself at ease  yet there had been that in his voice which was       not like ease  whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in       seeing her she could not tell  but he certainly had not seen her       with composure         at length  however  the remarks of her companions on her absence       of mind aroused her  and she felt the necessity of appearing more       like herself         they entered the woods  and bidding adieu to the river for a       while  ascended some of the higher grounds  when  in spots where       the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander  were many       charming views of the valley  the opposite hills  with the long       range of woods overspreading many  and occasionally part of the       stream  mr  gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole       park  but feared it might be beyond a walk  with a triumphant       smile they were told that it was ten miles round  it settled the       matter  and they pursued the accustomed circuit  which brought       them again  after some time  in a descent among hanging woods  to       the edge of the water  and one of its narrowest parts  they       crossed it by a simple bridge  in character with the general air       of the scene  it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet       visited  and the valley  here contracted into a glen  allowed       room only for the stream  and a narrow walk amidst the rough       coppice wood which bordered it  elizabeth longed to explore its       windings  but when they had crossed the bridge  and perceived       their distance from the house  mrs  gardiner  who was not a great       walker  could go no farther  and thought only of returning to the       carriage as quickly as possible  her niece was  therefore        obliged to submit  and they took their way towards the house on       the opposite side of the river  in the nearest direction  but       their progress was slow  for mr  gardiner  though seldom able to       indulge the taste  was very fond of fishing  and was so much       engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in       the water  and talking to the man about them  that he advanced       but little  whilst wandering on in this slow manner  they were       again surprised  and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to       what it had been at first  by the sight of mr  darcy approaching       them  and at no great distance  the walk being here less       sheltered than on the other side  allowed them to see him before       they met  elizabeth  however astonished  was at least more       prepared for an interview than before  and resolved to appear and       to speak with calmness  if he really intended to meet them  for a       few moments  indeed  she felt that he would probably strike into       some other path  the idea lasted while a turning in the walk       concealed him from their view  the turning past  he was       immediately before them  with a glance  she saw that he had lost       none of his recent civility  and  to imitate his politeness  she       began  as they met  to admire the beauty of the place  but she       had not got beyond the words  delightful   and  charming   when       some unlucky recollections obtruded  and she fancied that praise       of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed  her       colour changed  and she said no more         mrs  gardiner was standing a little behind  and on her pausing        he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to       her friends  this was a stroke of civility for which she was       quite unprepared  and she could hardly suppress a smile at his       being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people       against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself         what will be his surprise   thought she   when he knows who they       are  he takes them now for people of fashion          the introduction  however  was immediately made  and as she named       their relationship to herself  she stole a sly look at him  to       see how he bore it  and was not without the expectation of his       decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions        that he was surprised by the connection was evident  he       sustained it  however  with fortitude  and so far from going       away  turned back with them  and entered into conversation with       mr  gardiner  elizabeth could not but be pleased  could not but       triumph  it was consoling that he should know she had some       relations for whom there was no need to blush  she listened most       attentively to all that passed between them  and gloried in every       expression  every sentence of her uncle  which marked his       intelligence  his taste  or his good manners         the conversation soon turned upon fishing  and she heard mr        darcy invite him  with the greatest civility  to fish there as       often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood        offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle  and       pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually       most sport  mrs  gardiner  who was walking arm in arm with       elizabeth  gave her a look expressive of wonder  elizabeth said       nothing  but it gratified her exceedingly  the compliment must be       all for herself  her astonishment  however  was extreme  and       continually was she repeating   why is he so altered  from what       can it proceed  it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake       that his manners are thus softened  my reproofs at hunsford could       not work such a change as this  it is impossible that he should       still love me          after walking some time in this way  the two ladies in front  the       two gentlemen behind  on resuming their places  after descending       to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some       curious water plant  there chanced to be a little alteration  it       originated in mrs  gardiner  who  fatigued by the exercise of the       morning  found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support  and       consequently preferred her husband s  mr  darcy took her place by       her niece  and they walked on together  after a short silence        the lady first spoke  she wished him to know that she had been       assured of his absence before she came to the place  and       accordingly began by observing  that his arrival had been very       unexpected  for your housekeeper   she added   informed us that       you would certainly not be here till to morrow  and indeed        before we left bakewell  we understood that you were not       immediately expected in the country   he acknowledged the truth       of it all  and said that business with his steward had occasioned       his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with       whom he had been travelling   they will join me early to morrow         he continued   and among them are some who will claim an       acquaintance with you mr  bingley and his sisters          elizabeth answered only by a slight bow  her thoughts were       instantly driven back to the time when mr  bingley s name had       been the last mentioned between them  and  if she might judge by       his complexion  his mind was not very differently engaged          there is also one other person in the party   he continued after       a pause   who more particularly wishes to be known to you  will       you allow me  or do i ask too much  to introduce my sister to       your acquaintance during your stay at lambton          the surprise of such an application was great indeed  it was too       great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it  she       immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of       being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother  and        without looking farther  it was satisfactory  it was gratifying       to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of       her         they now walked on in silence  each of them deep in thought        elizabeth was not comfortable  that was impossible  but she was       flattered and pleased  his wish of introducing his sister to her       was a compliment of the highest kind  they soon outstripped the       others  and when they had reached the carriage  mr  and mrs        gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind         he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself       not tired  and they stood together on the lawn  at such a time       much might have been said  and silence was very awkward  she       wanted to talk  but there seemed to be an embargo on every       subject  at last she recollected that she had been travelling        and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance        yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas       were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over         on mr  and mrs  gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go       into the house and take some refreshment  but this was declined        and they parted on each side with utmost politeness  mr  darcy       handed the ladies into the carriage  and when it drove off        elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house         the observations of her uncle and aunt now began  and each of       them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they       had expected   he is perfectly well behaved  polite  and       unassuming   said her uncle          there is something a little stately in him  to be sure         replied her aunt   but it is confined to his air  and is not       unbecoming  i can now say with the housekeeper  that though some       people may call him proud  i have seen nothing of it           i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us  it was       more than civil  it was really attentive  and there was no       necessity for such attention  his acquaintance with elizabeth was       very trifling           to be sure  lizzy   said her aunt   he is not so handsome as       wickham  or  rather  he has not wickham s countenance  for his       features are perfectly good  but how came you to tell me that he       was so disagreeable          elizabeth excused herself as well as she could  said that she had       liked him better when they had met in kent than before  and that       she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning          but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities         replied her uncle   your great men often are  and therefore i       shall not take him at his word  as he might change his mind       another day  and warn me off his grounds          elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his       character  but said nothing          from what we have seen of him   continued mrs  gardiner   i       really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so       cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham  he has not       an ill natured look  on the contrary  there is something pleasing       about his mouth when he speaks  and there is something of dignity       in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea       of his heart  but  to be sure  the good lady who showed us his       house did give him a most flaming character  i could hardly help       laughing aloud sometimes  but he is a liberal master  i suppose        and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue          elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in       vindication of his behaviour to wickham  and therefore gave them       to understand  in as guarded a manner as she could  that by what       she had heard from his relations in kent  his actions were       capable of a very different construction  and that his character       was by no means so faulty  nor wickham s so amiable  as they had       been considered in hertfordshire  in confirmation of this  she       related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in       which they had been connected  without actually naming her       authority  but stating it to be such as might be relied on         mrs  gardiner was surprised and concerned  but as they were now       approaching the scene of her former pleasures  every idea gave       way to the charm of recollection  and she was too much engaged in       pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its       environs to think of anything else  fatigued as she had been by       the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off       again in quest of her former acquaintance  and the evening was       spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many       years  discontinuance         the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave       elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends  and she       could do nothing but think  and think with wonder  of mr  darcy s       civility  and  above all  of his wishing her to be acquainted       with his sister              elizabeth had settled it that mr  darcy would bring his sister to       visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley  and was       consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole       of that morning  but her conclusion was false  for on the very       morning after their arrival at lambton  these visitors came  they       had been walking about the place with some of their new friends        and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining       with the same family  when the sound of a carriage drew them to a       window  and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving       up the street  elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery        guessed what it meant  and imparted no small degree of her       surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour       which she expected  her uncle and aunt were all amazement  and       the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke  joined to the       circumstance itself  and many of the circumstances of the       preceding day  opened to them a new idea on the business  nothing       had ever suggested it before  but they felt that there was no       other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter       than by supposing a partiality for their niece  while these       newly born notions were passing in their heads  the perturbation       of elizabeth s feelings was at every moment increasing  she was       quite amazed at her own discomposure  but amongst other causes of       disquiet  she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should       have said too much in her favour  and  more than commonly anxious       to please  she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing       would fail her         she retreated from the window  fearful of being seen  and as she       walked up and down the room  endeavouring to compose herself  saw       such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made       everything worse         miss darcy and her brother appeared  and this formidable       introduction took place  with astonishment did elizabeth see that       her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself        since her being at lambton  she had heard that miss darcy was       exceedingly proud  but the observation of a very few minutes       convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy  she found it       difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable         miss darcy was tall  and on a larger scale than elizabeth  and        though little more than sixteen  her figure was formed  and her       appearance womanly and graceful  she was less handsome than her       brother  but there was sense and good humour in her face  and her       manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle  elizabeth  who had       expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as       ever mr  darcy had been  was much relieved by discerning such       different feelings         they had not long been together before mr  darcy told her that       bingley was also coming to wait on her  and she had barely time       to express her satisfaction  and prepare for such a visitor  when       bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs  and in a moment he       entered the room  all elizabeth s anger against him had been long       done away  but had she still felt any  it could hardly have stood       its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he       expressed himself on seeing her again  he enquired in a friendly        though general way  after her family  and looked and spoke with       the same good humoured ease that he had ever done         to mr  and mrs  gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting       personage than to herself  they had long wished to see him  the       whole party before them  indeed  excited a lively attention  the       suspicions which had just arisen of mr  darcy and their niece       directed their observation towards each with an earnest though       guarded enquiry  and they soon drew from those enquiries the full       conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love  of       the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt  but that       the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough         elizabeth  on her side  had much to do  she wanted to ascertain       the feelings of each of her visitors  she wanted to compose her       own  and to make herself agreeable to all  and in the latter       object  where she feared most to fail  she was most sure of       success  for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were       prepossessed in her favour  bingley was ready  georgiana was       eager  and darcy determined  to be pleased         in seeing bingley  her thoughts naturally flew to her sister        and  oh  how ardently did she long to know whether any of his       were directed in a like manner  sometimes she could fancy that he       talked less than on former occasions  and once or twice pleased       herself with the notion that  as he looked at her  he was trying       to trace a resemblance  but  though this might be imaginary  she       could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy  who had       been set up as a rival to jane  no look appeared on either side       that spoke particular regard  nothing occurred between them that       could justify the hopes of his sister  on this point she was soon       satisfied  and two or three little circumstances occurred ere       they parted  which  in her anxious interpretation  denoted a       recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness  and a wish of       saying more that might lead to the mention of her  had he dared        he observed to her  at a moment when the others were talking       together  and in a tone which had something of real regret  that       it  was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing       her   and  before she could reply  he added   it is above eight       months  we have not met since the  of november  when we were       all dancing together at netherfield          elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact  and he       afterwards took occasion to ask her  when unattended to by any of       the rest  whether all her sisters were at longbourn  there was       not much in the question  nor in the preceding remark  but there       was a look and a manner which gave them meaning         it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr  darcy       himself  but  whenever she did catch a glimpse  she saw an       expression of general complaisance  and in all that he said she       heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his       companions  as convinced her that the improvement of manners       which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence       might prove  had at least outlived one day  when she saw him thus       seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people       with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a       disgrace when she saw him thus civil  not only to herself  but to       the very relations whom he had openly disdained  and recollected       their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference  the       change was so great  and struck so forcibly on her mind  that she       could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible  never        even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield  or his       dignified relations at rosings  had she seen him so desirous to       please  so free from self consequence or unbending reserve  as       now  when no importance could result from the success of his       endeavours  and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his       attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and       censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings         their visitors stayed with them above half an hour  and when they       arose to depart  mr  darcy called on his sister to join him in       expressing their wish of seeing mr  and mrs  gardiner  and miss       bennet  to dinner at pemberley  before they left the country        miss darcy  though with a diffidence which marked her little in       the habit of giving invitations  readily obeyed  mrs  gardiner       looked at her niece  desirous of knowing how she  whom the       invitation most concerned  felt disposed as to its acceptance        but elizabeth had turned away her head  presuming however  that       this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment       than any dislike of the proposal  and seeing in her husband  who       was fond of society  a perfect willingness to accept it  she       ventured to engage for her attendance  and the day after the next       was fixed on         bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing       elizabeth again  having still a great deal to say to her  and       many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends        elizabeth  construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak       of her sister  was pleased  and on this account  as well as some       others  found herself  when their visitors left them  capable of       considering the last half hour with some satisfaction  though       while it was passing  the enjoyment of it had been little  eager       to be alone  and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and       aunt  she stayed with them only long enough to hear their       favourable opinion of bingley  and then hurried away to dress         but she had no reason to fear mr  and mrs  gardiner s curiosity        it was not their wish to force her communication  it was evident       that she was much better acquainted with mr  darcy than they had       before any idea of  it was evident that he was very much in love       with her  they saw much to interest  but nothing to justify       enquiry         of mr  darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well  and        as far as their acquaintance reached  there was no fault to find        they could not be untouched by his politeness  and had they drawn       his character from their own feelings and his servant s report        without any reference to any other account  the circle in       hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it       for mr  darcy  there was now an interest  however  in believing       the housekeeper  and they soon became sensible that the authority       of a servant who had known him since he was four years old  and       whose own manners indicated respectability  was not to be hastily       rejected  neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of       their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight        they had nothing to accuse him of but pride  pride he probably       had  and if not  it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants       of a small market town where the family did not visit  it was       acknowledged  however  that he was a liberal man  and did much       good among the poor         with respect to wickham  the travellers soon found that he was       not held there in much estimation  for though the chief of his       concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood        it was yet a well known fact that  on his quitting derbyshire  he       had left many debts behind him  which mr  darcy afterwards       discharged         as for elizabeth  her thoughts were at pemberley this evening       more than the last  and the evening  though as it passed it       seemed long  was not long enough to determine her feelings       towards one in that mansion  and she lay awake two whole hours       endeavouring to make them out  she certainly did not hate him        no  hatred had vanished long ago  and she had almost as long been       ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him  that could be so       called  the respect created by the conviction of his valuable       qualities  though at first unwillingly admitted  had for some       time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling  and it was now       heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature  by the testimony       so highly in his favour  and bringing forward his disposition in       so amiable a light  which yesterday had produced  but above all        above respect and esteem  there was a motive within her of       goodwill which could not be overlooked  it was gratitude        gratitude  not merely for having once loved her  but for loving       her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony       of her manner in rejecting him  and all the unjust accusations       accompanying her rejection  he who  she had been persuaded  would       avoid her as his greatest enemy  seemed  on this accidental       meeting  most eager to preserve the acquaintance  and without any       indelicate display of regard  or any peculiarity of manner  where       their two selves only were concerned  was soliciting the good       opinion of her friends  and bent on making her known to his       sister  such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only       astonishment but gratitude for to love  ardent love  it must be       attributed  and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be       encouraged  as by no means unpleasing  though it could not be       exactly defined  she respected  she esteemed  she was grateful to       him  she felt a real interest in his welfare  and she only wanted       to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself        and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should       employ the power  which her fancy told her she still possessed        of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses         it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the       niece  that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to       see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley  for she had       reached it only to a late breakfast  ought to be imitated  though       it could not be equalled  by some exertion of politeness on their       side  and  consequently  that it would be highly expedient to       wait on her at pemberley the following morning  they were        therefore  to go  elizabeth was pleased  though when she asked       herself the reason  she had very little to say in reply         mr  gardiner left them soon after breakfast  the fishing scheme       had been renewed the day before  and a positive engagement made       of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon              convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her       had originated in jealousy  she could not help feeling how       unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her  and was       curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the       acquaintance would now be renewed         on reaching the house  they were shown through the hall into the       saloon  whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer        its windows opening to the ground  admitted a most refreshing       view of the high woody hills behind the house  and of the       beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over       the intermediate lawn         in this house they were received by miss darcy  who was sitting       there with mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and the lady with whom       she lived in london  georgiana s reception of them was very       civil  but attended with all the embarrassment which  though       proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong  would easily       give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her       being proud and reserved  mrs  gardiner and her niece  however        did her justice  and pitied her         by mrs  hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a       curtsey  and  on their being seated  a pause  awkward as such       pauses must always be  succeeded for a few moments  it was first       broken by mrs  annesley  a genteel  agreeable looking woman        whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to       be more truly well bred than either of the others  and between       her and mrs  gardiner  with occasional help from elizabeth  the       conversation was carried on  miss darcy looked as if she wished       for courage enough to join in it  and sometimes did venture a       short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard         elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss       bingley  and that she could not speak a word  especially to miss       darcy  without calling her attention  this observation would not       have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter  had they       not been seated at an inconvenient distance  but she was not       sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much  her own thoughts       were employing her  she expected every moment that some of the       gentlemen would enter the room  she wished  she feared that the       master of the house might be amongst them  and whether she wished       or feared it most  she could scarcely determine  after sitting in       this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley s       voice  elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry       after the health of her family  she answered with equal       indifference and brevity  and the other said no more         the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the       entrance of servants with cold meat  cake  and a variety of all       the finest fruits in season  but this did not take place till       after many a significant look and smile from mrs  annesley to       miss darcy had been given  to remind her of her post  there was       now employment for the whole party for though they could not all       talk  they could all eat  and the beautiful pyramids of grapes        nectarines  and peaches soon collected them round the table         while thus engaged  elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding       whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr        darcy  by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room        and then  though but a moment before she had believed her wishes       to predominate  she began to regret that he came         he had been some time with mr  gardiner  who  with two or three       other gentlemen from the house  was engaged by the river  and had       left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended       a visit to georgiana that morning  no sooner did he appear than       elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed        a resolution the more necessary to be made  but perhaps not the       more easily kept  because she saw that the suspicions of the       whole party were awakened against them  and that there was       scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first       came into the room  in no countenance was attentive curiosity so       strongly marked as in miss bingley s  in spite of the smiles       which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its       objects  for jealousy had not yet made her desperate  and her       attentions to mr  darcy were by no means over  miss darcy  on her       brother s entrance  exerted herself much more to talk  and       elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to       get acquainted  and forwarded as much as possible  every attempt       at conversation on either side  miss bingley saw all this       likewise  and  in the imprudence of anger  took the first       opportunity of saying  with sneering civility          pray  miss eliza  are not the   shire militia removed from       meryton  they must be a great loss to your family          in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name  but       elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her       thoughts  and the various recollections connected with him gave       her a moment s distress  but exerting herself vigorously to repel       the ill natured attack  she presently answered the question in a       tolerably detached tone  while she spoke  an involuntary glance       showed her darcy  with a heightened complexion  earnestly looking       at her  and his sister overcome with confusion  and unable to       lift up her eyes  had miss bingley known what pain she was then       giving her beloved friend  she undoubtedly would have refrained       from the hint  but she had merely intended to discompose       elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she       believed her partial  to make her betray a sensibility which       might injure her in darcy s opinion  and  perhaps  to remind the       latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of       her family were connected with that corps  not a syllable had       ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement  to no       creature had it been revealed  where secrecy was possible  except       to elizabeth  and from all bingley s connections her brother was       particularly anxious to conceal it  from the very wish which       elizabeth had long ago attributed to him  of their becoming       hereafter her own  he had certainly formed such a plan  and       without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate       him from miss bennet  it is probable that it might add something       to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend         elizabeth s collected behaviour  however  soon quieted his       emotion  and as miss bingley  vexed and disappointed  dared not       approach nearer to wickham  georgiana also recovered in time        though not enough to be able to speak any more  her brother        whose eye she feared to meet  scarcely recollected her interest       in the affair  and the very circumstance which had been designed       to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on       her more and more cheerfully         their visit did not continue long after the question and answer       above mentioned  and while mr  darcy was attending them to their       carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on       elizabeth s person  behaviour  and dress  but georgiana would not       join her  her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her       favour  his judgement could not err  and he had spoken in such       terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of       finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable  when darcy       returned to the saloon  miss bingley could not help repeating to       him some part of what she had been saying to his sister          how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning  mr  darcy         she cried   i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she       is since the winter  she is grown so brown and coarse  louisa and       i were agreeing that we should not have known her again          however little mr  darcy might have liked such an address  he       contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other       alteration than her being rather tanned  no miraculous       consequence of travelling in the summer          for my own part   she rejoined   i must confess that i never       could see any beauty in her  her face is too thin  her complexion       has no brilliancy  and her features are not at all handsome  her       nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines  her       teeth are tolerable  but not out of the common way  and as for       her eyes  which have sometimes been called so fine  i could never       see anything extraordinary in them  they have a sharp  shrewish       look  which i do not like at all  and in her air altogether there       is a self sufficiency without fashion  which is intolerable          persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth  this       was not the best method of recommending herself  but angry people       are not always wise  and in seeing him at last look somewhat       nettled  she had all the success she expected  he was resolutely       silent  however  and  from a determination of making him speak        she continued          i remember  when we first knew her in hertfordshire  how amazed       we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty  and i       particularly recollect your saying one night  after they had been       dining at netherfield   she a beauty  i should as soon call her       mother a wit   but afterwards she seemed to improve on you  and i       believe you thought her rather pretty at one time           yes   replied darcy  who could contain himself no longer   but       that was only when i first saw her  for it is many months since       i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my       acquaintance          he then went away  and miss bingley was left to all the       satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any       pain but herself         mrs  gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred       during their visit  as they returned  except what had       particularly interested them both  the look and behaviour of       everybody they had seen were discussed  except of the person who       had mostly engaged their attention  they talked of his sister        his friends  his house  his fruit of everything but himself  yet       elizabeth was longing to know what mrs  gardiner thought of him        and mrs  gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s       beginning the subject              elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a       letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton  and this       disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had       now been spent there  but on the third her repining was over  and       her sister justified  by the receipt of two letters from her at       once  on one of which was marked that it had been missent       elsewhere  elizabeth was not surprised at it  as jane had written       the direction remarkably ill         they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in  and       her uncle and aunt  leaving her to enjoy them in quiet  set off       by themselves  the one missent must first be attended to  it had       been written five days ago  the beginning contained an account of       all their little parties and engagements  with such news as the       country afforded  but the latter half  which was dated a day       later  and written in evident agitation  gave more important       intelligence  it was to this effect          since writing the above  dearest lizzy  something has occurred       of a most unexpected and serious nature  but i am afraid of       alarming you be assured that we are all well  what i have to say       relates to poor lydia  an express came at twelve last night  just       as we were all gone to bed  from colonel forster  to inform us       that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers  to       own the truth  with wickham  imagine our surprise  to kitty        however  it does not seem so wholly unexpected  i am very  very       sorry  so imprudent a match on both sides  but i am willing to       hope the best  and that his character has been misunderstood        thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him  but this       step  and let us rejoice over it  marks nothing bad at heart  his       choice is disinterested at least  for he must know my father can       give her nothing  our poor mother is sadly grieved  my father       bears it better  how thankful am i that we never let them know       what has been said against him  we must forget it ourselves  they       were off saturday night about twelve  as is conjectured  but were       not missed till yesterday morning at eight  the express was sent       off directly  my dear lizzy  they must have passed within ten       miles of us  colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here       soon  lydia left a few lines for his wife  informing her of their       intention  i must conclude  for i cannot be long from my poor       mother  i am afraid you will not be able to make it out  but i       hardly know what i have written          without allowing herself time for consideration  and scarcely       knowing what she felt  elizabeth on finishing this letter       instantly seized the other  and opening it with the utmost       impatience  read as follows  it had been written a day later than       the conclusion of the first          by this time  my dearest sister  you have received my hurried       letter  i wish this may be more intelligible  but though not       confined for time  my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer       for being coherent  dearest lizzy  i hardly know what i would       write  but i have bad news for you  and it cannot be delayed        imprudent as the marriage between mr  wickham and our poor lydia       would be  we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place        for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to       scotland  colonel forster came yesterday  having left brighton       the day before  not many hours after the express  though lydia s       short letter to mrs  f  gave them to understand that they were       going to gretna green  something was dropped by denny expressing       his belief that w  never intended to go there  or to marry lydia       at all  which was repeated to colonel f   who  instantly taking       the alarm  set off from b  intending to trace their route  he did       trace them easily to clapham  but no further  for on entering       that place  they removed into a hackney coach  and dismissed the       chaise that brought them from epsom  all that is known after this       is  that they were seen to continue the london road  i know not       what to think  after making every possible enquiry on that side       london  colonel f  came on into hertfordshire  anxiously renewing       them at all the turnpikes  and at the inns in barnet and       hatfield  but without any success no such people had been seen to       pass through  with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn        and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to       his heart  i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs  f   but no one       can throw any blame on them  our distress  my dear lizzy  is very       great  my father and mother believe the worst  but i cannot think       so ill of him  many circumstances might make it more eligible for       them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first       plan  and even if he could form such a design against a young       woman of lydia s connections  which is not likely  can i suppose       her so lost to everything  impossible  i grieve to find  however        that colonel f  is not disposed to depend upon their marriage  he       shook his head when i expressed my hopes  and said he feared w        was not a man to be trusted  my poor mother is really ill  and       keeps her room  could she exert herself  it would be better  but       this is not to be expected  and as to my father  i never in my       life saw him so affected  poor kitty has anger for having       concealed their attachment  but as it was a matter of confidence        one cannot wonder  i am truly glad  dearest lizzy  that you have       been spared something of these distressing scenes  but now  as       the first shock is over  shall i own that i long for your return        i am not so selfish  however  as to press for it  if       inconvenient  adieu  i take up my pen again to do what i have       just told you i would not  but circumstances are such that i       cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as       possible  i know my dear uncle and aunt so well  that i am not       afraid of requesting it  though i have still something more to       ask of the former  my father is going to london with colonel       forster instantly  to try to discover her  what he means to do i       am sure i know not  but his excessive distress will not allow him       to pursue any measure in the best and safest way  and colonel       forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening  in       such an exigence  my uncle s advice and assistance would be       everything in the world  he will immediately comprehend what i       must feel  and i rely upon his goodness           oh  where  where is my uncle   cried elizabeth  darting from her       seat as she finished the letter  in eagerness to follow him        without losing a moment of the time so precious  but as she       reached the door it was opened by a servant  and mr  darcy       appeared  her pale face and impetuous manner made him start  and       before he could recover himself to speak  she  in whose mind       every idea was superseded by lydia s situation  hastily       exclaimed   i beg your pardon  but i must leave you  i must find       mr  gardiner this moment  on business that cannot be delayed  i       have not an instant to lose           good god  what is the matter   cried he  with more feeling than       politeness  then recollecting himself   i will not detain you a       minute  but let me  or let the servant go after mr  and mrs        gardiner  you are not well enough  you cannot go yourself          elizabeth hesitated  but her knees trembled under her and she       felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them        calling back the servant  therefore  she commissioned him  though       in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible  to       fetch his master and mistress home instantly         on his quitting the room she sat down  unable to support herself        and looking so miserably ill  that it was impossible for darcy to       leave her  or to refrain from saying  in a tone of gentleness and       commiseration   let me call your maid  is there nothing you could       take to give you present relief  a glass of wine  shall i get you       one  you are very ill           no  i thank you   she replied  endeavouring to recover herself         there is nothing the matter with me  i am quite well  i am only       distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from       longbourn          she burst into tears as she alluded to it  and for a few minutes       could not speak another word  darcy  in wretched suspense  could       only say something indistinctly of his concern  and observe her       in compassionate silence  at length she spoke again   i have just       had a letter from jane  with such dreadful news  it cannot be       concealed from anyone  my younger sister has left all her       friends has eloped  has thrown herself into the power of of mr        wickham  they are gone off together from brighton  you know him       too well to doubt the rest  she has no money  no connections        nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever          darcy was fixed in astonishment   when i consider   she added in       a yet more agitated voice   that i might have prevented it  i       who knew what he was  had i but explained some part of it       only some part of what i learnt  to my own family  had his       character been known  this could not have happened  but it is       all all too late now           i am grieved indeed   cried darcy   grieved shocked  but is it       certain absolutely certain           oh  yes  they left brighton together on sunday night  and were       traced almost to london  but not beyond  they are certainly not       gone to scotland           and what has been done  what has been attempted  to recover       her           my father is gone to london  and jane has written to beg my       uncle s immediate assistance  and we shall be off  i hope  in       half an hour  but nothing can be done i know very well that       nothing can be done  how is such a man to be worked on  how are       they even to be discovered  i have not the smallest hope  it is       every way horrible          darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence          when my eyes were opened to his real character oh  had i known       what i ought  what i dared to do  but i knew not i was afraid of       doing too much  wretched  wretched mistake          darcy made no answer  he seemed scarcely to hear her  and was       walking up and down the room in earnest meditation  his brow       contracted  his air gloomy  elizabeth soon observed  and       instantly understood it  her power was sinking  everything must       sink under such a proof of family weakness  such an assurance of       the deepest disgrace  she could neither wonder nor condemn  but       the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to       her bosom  afforded no palliation of her distress  it was  on the       contrary  exactly calculated to make her understand her own       wishes  and never had she so honestly felt that she could have       loved him  as now  when all love must be vain         but self  though it would intrude  could not engross her        lydia the humiliation  the misery she was bringing on them all        soon swallowed up every private care  and covering her face with       her handkerchief  elizabeth was soon lost to everything else        and  after a pause of several minutes  was only recalled to a       sense of her situation by the voice of her companion  who  in a       manner which  though it spoke compassion  spoke likewise       restraint  said   i am afraid you have been long desiring my       absence  nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay  but       real  though unavailing concern  would to heaven that anything       could be either said or done on my part that might offer       consolation to such distress  but i will not torment you with       vain wishes  which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks        this unfortunate affair will  i fear  prevent my sister s having       the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day           oh  yes  be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy  say       that urgent business calls us home immediately  conceal the       unhappy truth as long as it is possible  i know it cannot be       long          he readily assured her of his secrecy  again expressed his sorrow       for her distress  wished it a happier conclusion than there was       at present reason to hope  and leaving his compliments for her       relations  with only one serious  parting look  went away         as he quitted the room  elizabeth felt how improbable it was that       they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality       as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire  and as she       threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their       acquaintance  so full of contradictions and varieties  sighed at       the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted       its continuance  and would formerly have rejoiced in its       termination         if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection        elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor       faulty  but if otherwise if regard springing from such sources is       unreasonable or unnatural  in comparison of what is so often       described as arising on a first interview with its object  and       even before two words have been exchanged  nothing can be said in       her defence  except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the       latter method in her partiality for wickham  and that its ill       success might  perhaps  authorise her to seek the other less       interesting mode of attachment  be that as it may  she saw him go       with regret  and in this early example of what lydia s infamy       must produce  found additional anguish as she reflected on that       wretched business  never  since reading jane s second letter  had       she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her  no one       but jane  she thought  could flatter herself with such an       expectation  surprise was the least of her feelings on this       development  while the contents of the first letter remained in       her mind  she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham       should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for       money  and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared       incomprehensible  but now it was all too natural  for such an       attachment as this she might have sufficient charms  and though       she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an       elopement without the intention of marriage  she had no       difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her       understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey         she had never perceived  while the regiment was in hertfordshire        that lydia had any partiality for him  but she was convinced that       lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody        sometimes one officer  sometimes another  had been her favourite        as their attentions raised them in her opinion  her affections       had continually been fluctuating but never without an object  the       mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a       girl oh  how acutely did she now feel it         she was wild to be at home to hear  to see  to be upon the spot       to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon       her  in a family so deranged  a father absent  a mother incapable       of exertion  and requiring constant attendance  and though almost       persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia  her uncle s       interference seemed of the utmost importance  and till he entered       the room her impatience was severe  mr  and mrs  gardiner had       hurried back in alarm  supposing by the servant s account that       their niece was taken suddenly ill  but satisfying them instantly       on that head  she eagerly communicated the cause of their       summons  reading the two letters aloud  and dwelling on the       postscript of the last with trembling energy   though lydia had       never been a favourite with them  mr  and mrs  gardiner could not       but be deeply afflicted  not lydia only  but all were concerned       in it  and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror        mr  gardiner promised every assistance in his power  elizabeth        though expecting no less  thanked him with tears of gratitude        and all three being actuated by one spirit  everything relating       to their journey was speedily settled  they were to be off as       soon as possible   but what is to be done about pemberley   cried       mrs  gardiner   john told us mr  darcy was here when you sent for       us  was it so           yes  and i told him we should not be able to keep our       engagement  that is all settled           that is all settled   repeated the other  as she ran into her       room to prepare   and are they upon such terms as for her to       disclose the real truth  oh  that i knew how it was          but wishes were vain  or at least could only serve to amuse her       in the hurry and confusion of the following hour  had elizabeth       been at leisure to be idle  she would have remained certain that       all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself  but       she had her share of business as well as her aunt  and amongst       the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at       lambton  with false excuses for their sudden departure  an hour        however  saw the whole completed  and mr  gardiner meanwhile       having settled his account at the inn  nothing remained to be       done but to go  and elizabeth  after all the misery of the       morning  found herself  in a shorter space of time than she could       have supposed  seated in the carriage  and on the road to       longbourn               i have been thinking it over again  elizabeth   said her uncle        as they drove from the town   and really  upon serious       consideration  i am much more inclined than i was to judge as       your eldest sister does on the matter  it appears to me so very       unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a       girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless  and who was       actually staying in his colonel s family  that i am strongly       inclined to hope the best  could he expect that her friends would       not step forward  could he expect to be noticed again by the       regiment  after such an affront to colonel forster  his       temptation is not adequate to the risk           do you really think so   cried elizabeth  brightening up for a       moment          upon my word   said mrs  gardiner   i begin to be of your       uncle s opinion  it is really too great a violation of decency        honour  and interest  for him to be guilty of  i cannot think so       very ill of wickham  can you yourself  lizzy  so wholly give him       up  as to believe him capable of it           not  perhaps  of neglecting his own interest  but of every other       neglect i can believe him capable  if  indeed  it should be so        but i dare not hope it  why should they not go on to scotland if       that had been the case           in the first place   replied mr  gardiner   there is no absolute       proof that they are not gone to scotland           oh  but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is       such a presumption  and  besides  no traces of them were to be       found on the barnet road           well  then supposing them to be in london  they may be there        though for the purpose of concealment  for no more exceptional       purpose  it is not likely that money should be very abundant on       either side  and it might strike them that they could be more       economically  though less expeditiously  married in london than       in scotland           but why all this secrecy  why any fear of detection  why must       their marriage be private  oh  no  no this is not likely  his       most particular friend  you see by jane s account  was persuaded       of his never intending to marry her  wickham will never marry a       woman without some money  he cannot afford it  and what claims       has lydia what attraction has she beyond youth  health  and good       humour that could make him  for her sake  forego every chance of       benefiting himself by marrying well  as to what restraint the       apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a       dishonourable elopement with her  i am not able to judge  for i       know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce  but       as to your other objection  i am afraid it will hardly hold good        lydia has no brothers to step forward  and he might imagine  from       my father s behaviour  from his indolence and the little       attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in       his family  that he would do as little  and think as little       about it  as any father could do  in such a matter           but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love       of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than       marriage           it does seem  and it is most shocking indeed   replied       elizabeth  with tears in her eyes   that a sister s sense of       decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt  but        really  i know not what to say  perhaps i am not doing her       justice  but she is very young  she has never been taught to       think on serious subjects  and for the last half year  nay  for a       twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and       vanity  she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most       idle and frivolous manner  and to adopt any opinions that came in       her way  since the   shire were first quartered in meryton        nothing but love  flirtation  and officers have been in her head        she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and       talking on the subject  to give greater what shall i call it        susceptibility to her feelings  which are naturally lively       enough  and we all know that wickham has every charm of person       and address that can captivate a woman           but you see that jane   said her aunt   does not think so very       ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt           of whom does jane ever think ill  and who is there  whatever       might be their former conduct  that she would think capable of       such an attempt  till it were proved against them  but jane       knows  as well as i do  what wickham really is  we both know that       he has been profligate in every sense of the word  that he has       neither integrity nor honour  that he is as false and deceitful       as he is insinuating           and do you really know all this   cried mrs  gardiner  whose       curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive          i do indeed   replied elizabeth  colouring   i told you  the       other day  of his infamous behaviour to mr  darcy  and you       yourself  when last at longbourn  heard in what manner he spoke       of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality       towards him  and there are other circumstances which i am not at       liberty which it is not worth while to relate  but his lies about       the whole pemberley family are endless  from what he said of miss       darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud  reserved        disagreeable girl  yet he knew to the contrary himself  he must       know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found       her           but does lydia know nothing of this  can she be ignorant of what       you and jane seem so well to understand           oh  yes  that  that is the worst of all  till i was in kent  and       saw so much both of mr  darcy and his relation colonel       fitzwilliam  i was ignorant of the truth myself  and when i       returned home  the   shire was to leave meryton in a week or       fortnight s time  as that was the case  neither jane  to whom i       related the whole  nor i  thought it necessary to make our       knowledge public  for of what use could it apparently be to any       one  that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him       should then be overthrown  and even when it was settled that       lydia should go with mrs  forster  the necessity of opening her       eyes to his character never occurred to me  that she could be       in any danger from the deception never entered my head  that such       a consequence as this could ensue  you may easily believe  was       far enough from my thoughts           when they all removed to brighton  therefore  you had no reason        i suppose  to believe them fond of each other           not the slightest  i can remember no symptom of affection on       either side  and had anything of the kind been perceptible  you       must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be       thrown away  when first he entered the corps  she was ready       enough to admire him  but so we all were  every girl in or near       meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months        but he never distinguished her by any particular attention        and  consequently  after a moderate period of extravagant and       wild admiration  her fancy for him gave way  and others of the       regiment  who treated her with more distinction  again became her       favourites          it may be easily believed  that however little of novelty could       be added to their fears  hopes  and conjectures  on this       interesting subject  by its repeated discussion  no other could       detain them from it long  during the whole of the journey  from       elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent  fixed there by the       keenest of all anguish  self reproach  she could find no interval       of ease or forgetfulness         they travelled as expeditiously as possible  and  sleeping one       night on the road  reached longbourn by dinner time the next day        it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not       have been wearied by long expectations         the little gardiners  attracted by the sight of a chaise  were       standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock        and  when the carriage drove up to the door  the joyful surprise       that lighted up their faces  and displayed itself over their       whole bodies  in a variety of capers and frisks  was the first       pleasing earnest of their welcome         elizabeth jumped out  and  after giving each of them a hasty       kiss  hurried into the vestibule  where jane  who came running       down from her mother s apartment  immediately met her         elizabeth  as she affectionately embraced her  whilst tears       filled the eyes of both  lost not a moment in asking whether       anything had been heard of the fugitives          not yet   replied jane   but now that my dear uncle is come  i       hope everything will be well           is my father in town           yes  he went on tuesday  as i wrote you word           and have you heard from him often           we have heard only twice  he wrote me a few lines on wednesday       to say that he had arrived in safety  and to give me his       directions  which i particularly begged him to do  he merely       added that he should not write again till he had something of       importance to mention           and my mother how is she  how are you all           my mother is tolerably well  i trust  though her spirits are       greatly shaken  she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction       in seeing you all  she does not yet leave her dressing room  mary       and kitty  thank heaven  are quite well           but you how are you   cried elizabeth   you look pale  how much       you must have gone through          her sister  however  assured her of her being perfectly well  and       their conversation  which had been passing while mr  and mrs        gardiner were engaged with their children  was now put an end to       by the approach of the whole party  jane ran to her uncle and       aunt  and welcomed and thanked them both  with alternate smiles       and tears         when they were all in the drawing room  the questions which       elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the       others  and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to       give  the sanguine hope of good  however  which the benevolence       of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her  she still       expected that it would all end well  and that every morning would       bring some letter  either from lydia or her father  to explain       their proceedings  and  perhaps  announce their marriage         mrs  bennet  to whose apartment they all repaired  after a few       minutes  conversation together  received them exactly as might be       expected  with tears and lamentations of regret  invectives       against the villainous conduct of wickham  and complaints of her       own sufferings and ill usage  blaming everybody but the person to       whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must       principally be owing          if i had been able   said she   to carry my point in going to       brighton  with all my family  this would not have happened  but       poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her  why did the       forsters ever let her go out of their sight  i am sure there was       some great neglect or other on their side  for she is not the       kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked       after  i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge       of her  but i was overruled  as i always am  poor dear child  and       now here s mr  bennet gone away  and i know he will fight       wickham  wherever he meets him and then he will be killed  and       what is to become of us all  the collinses will turn us out       before he is cold in his grave  and if you are not kind to us        brother  i do not know what we shall do          they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas  and mr  gardiner        after general assurances of his affection for her and all her       family  told her that he meant to be in london the very next day        and would assist mr  bennet in every endeavour for recovering       lydia          do not give way to useless alarm   added he   though it is right       to be prepared for the worst  there is no occasion to look on it       as certain  it is not quite a week since they left brighton  in a       few days more we may gain some news of them  and till we know       that they are not married  and have no design of marrying  do not       let us give the matter over as lost  as soon as i get to town i       shall go to my brother  and make him come home with me to       gracechurch street  and then we may consult together as to what       is to be done           oh  my dear brother   replied mrs  bennet   that is exactly what       i could most wish for  and now do  when you get to town  find       them out  wherever they may be  and if they are not married       already  make them marry  and as for wedding clothes  do not       let them wait for that  but tell lydia she shall have as much       money as she chooses to buy them  after they are married  and        above all  keep mr  bennet from fighting  tell him what a       dreadful state i am in  that i am frighted out of my wits and       have such tremblings  such flutterings  all over me such spasms       in my side and pains in my head  and such beatings at heart  that       i can get no rest by night nor by day  and tell my dear lydia not       to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me        for she does not know which are the best warehouses  oh  brother        how kind you are  i know you will contrive it all          but mr  gardiner  though he assured her again of his earnest       endeavours in the cause  could not avoid recommending moderation       to her  as well in her hopes as her fear  and after talking with       her in this manner till dinner was on the table  they all left       her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper  who attended in       the absence of her daughters         though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no       real occasion for such a seclusion from the family  they did not       attempt to oppose it  for they knew that she had not prudence       enough to hold her tongue before the servants  while they waited       at table  and judged it better that one only of the household        and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her       fears and solicitude on the subject         in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty  who       had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make       their appearance before  one came from her books  and the other       from her toilette  the faces of both  however  were tolerably       calm  and no change was visible in either  except that the loss       of her favourite sister  or the anger which she had herself       incurred in this business  had given more of fretfulness than       usual to the accents of kitty  as for mary  she was mistress       enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth  with a countenance of       grave reflection  soon after they were seated at table          this is a most unfortunate affair  and will probably be much       talked of  but we must stem the tide of malice  and pour into the       wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation          then  perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying  she       added   unhappy as the event must be for lydia  we may draw from       it this useful lesson  that loss of virtue in a female is       irretrievable  that one false step involves her in endless ruin        that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful  and       that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the       undeserving of the other sex          elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement  but was too much       oppressed to make any reply  mary  however  continued to console       herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before       them         in the afternoon  the two elder miss bennets were able to be for       half an hour by themselves  and elizabeth instantly availed       herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries  which jane       was equally eager to satisfy  after joining in general       lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event  which       elizabeth considered as all but certain  and miss bennet could       not assert to be wholly impossible  the former continued the       subject  by saying   but tell me all and everything about it       which i have not already heard  give me further particulars  what       did colonel forster say  had they no apprehension of anything       before the elopement took place  they must have seen them       together for ever           colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some       partiality  especially on lydia s side  but nothing to give him       any alarm  i am so grieved for him  his behaviour was attentive       and kind to the utmost  he was coming to us  in order to assure       us of his concern  before he had any idea of their not being gone       to scotland  when that apprehension first got abroad  it hastened       his journey           and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry  did he       know of their intending to go off  had colonel forster seen denny       himself           yes  but  when questioned by him  denny denied knowing       anything of their plans  and would not give his real opinion       about it  he did not repeat his persuasion of their not       marrying and from that  i am inclined to hope  he might have       been misunderstood before           and till colonel forster came himself  not one of you       entertained a doubt  i suppose  of their being really married           how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains  i       felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness       with him in marriage  because i knew that his conduct had not       been always quite right  my father and mother knew nothing of       that  they only felt how imprudent a match it must be  kitty then       owned  with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest       of us  that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such       a step  she had known  it seems  of their being in love with each       other  many weeks           but not before they went to brighton           no  i believe not           and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself        does he know his real character           i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he       formerly did  he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant        and since this sad affair has taken place  it is said that he       left meryton greatly in debt  but i hope this may be false           oh  jane  had we been less secret  had we told what we knew of       him  this could not have happened           perhaps it would have been better   replied her sister   but to       expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their       present feelings were  seemed unjustifiable  we acted with the       best intentions           could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to       his wife           he brought it with him for us to see          jane then took it from her pocket book  and gave it to elizabeth        these were the contents          my dear harriet         you will laugh when you know where i am gone  and i cannot help       laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning  as soon as i       am missed  i am going to gretna green  and if you cannot guess       with who  i shall think you a simpleton  for there is but one man       in the world i love  and he is an angel  i should never be happy       without him  so think it no harm to be off  you need not send       them word at longbourn of my going  if you do not like it  for it       will make the surprise the greater  when i write to them and sign       my name  lydia wickham   what a good joke it will be  i can       hardly write for laughing  pray make my excuses to pratt for not       keeping my engagement  and dancing with him to night  tell him i       hope he will excuse me when he knows all  and tell him i will       dance with him at the next ball we meet  with great pleasure  i       shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn  but i wish you       would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown       before they are packed up  good bye  give my love to colonel       forster  i hope you will drink to our good journey          your affectionate friend         lydia bennet           oh  thoughtless  thoughtless lydia   cried elizabeth when she       had finished it   what a letter is this  to be written at such a       moment  but at least it shows that she was serious on the       subject of their journey  whatever he might afterwards persuade       her to  it was not on her side a scheme of infamy  my poor       father  how he must have felt it           i never saw anyone so shocked  he could not speak a word for       full ten minutes  my mother was taken ill immediately  and the       whole house in such confusion           oh  jane   cried elizabeth   was there a servant belonging to it       who did not know the whole story before the end of the day           i do not know  i hope there was  but to be guarded at such a       time is very difficult  my mother was in hysterics  and though i       endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power  i am afraid       i did not do so much as i might have done  but the horror of what       might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties           your attendance upon her has been too much for you  you do not       look well  oh that i had been with you  you have had every care       and anxiety upon yourself alone           mary and kitty have been very kind  and would have shared in       every fatigue  i am sure  but i did not think it right for either       of them  kitty is slight and delicate  and mary studies so much        that her hours of repose should not be broken in on  my aunt       phillips came to longbourn on tuesday  after my father went away        and was so good as to stay till thursday with me  she was of       great use and comfort to us all  and lady lucas has been very       kind  she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us        and offered her services  or any of her daughters   if they       should be of use to us           she had better have stayed at home   cried elizabeth   perhaps       she meant well  but  under such a misfortune as this  one       cannot see too little of one s neighbours  assistance is       impossible  condolence insufferable  let them triumph over us at       a distance  and be satisfied          she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father       had intended to pursue  while in town  for the recovery of his       daughter          he meant i believe   replied jane   to go to epsom  the place       where they last changed horses  see the postilions and try if       anything could be made out from them  his principal object must       be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them       from clapham  it had come with a fare from london  and as he       thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing       from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make       enquiries at clapham  if he could anyhow discover at what house       the coachman had before set down his fare  he determined to make       enquiries there  and hoped it might not be impossible to find out       the stand and number of the coach  i do not know of any other       designs that he had formed  but he was in such a hurry to be       gone  and his spirits so greatly discomposed  that i had       difficulty in finding out even so much as this               the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr  bennet the       next morning  but the post came in without bringing a single line       from him  his family knew him to be  on all common occasions  a       most negligent and dilatory correspondent  but at such a time       they had hoped for exertion  they were forced to conclude that he       had no pleasing intelligence to send  but even of that they       would have been glad to be certain  mr  gardiner had waited only       for the letters before he set off         when he was gone  they were certain at least of receiving       constant information of what was going on  and their uncle       promised  at parting  to prevail on mr  bennet to return to       longbourn  as soon as he could  to the great consolation of his       sister  who considered it as the only security for her husband s       not being killed in a duel         mrs  gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a       few days longer  as the former thought her presence might be       serviceable to her nieces  she shared in their attendance on mrs        bennet  and was a great comfort to them in their hours of       freedom  their other aunt also visited them frequently  and       always  as she said  with the design of cheering and heartening       them up though  as she never came without reporting some fresh       instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity  she seldom       went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found       them         all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who  but three       months before  had been almost an angel of light  he was declared       to be in debt to every tradesman in the place  and his intrigues        all honoured with the title of seduction  had been extended into       every tradesman s family  everybody declared that he was the       wickedest young man in the world  and everybody began to find out       that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness        elizabeth  though she did not credit above half of what was said        believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin       more certain  and even jane  who believed still less of it        became almost hopeless  more especially as the time was now come       when  if they had gone to scotland  which she had never before       entirely despaired of  they must in all probability have gained       some news of them         mr  gardiner left longbourn on sunday  on tuesday his wife       received a letter from him  it told them that  on his arrival  he       had immediately found out his brother  and persuaded him to come       to gracechurch street  that mr  bennet had been to epsom and       clapham  before his arrival  but without gaining any satisfactory       information  and that he was now determined to enquire at all the       principal hotels in town  as mr  bennet thought it possible they       might have gone to one of them  on their first coming to london        before they procured lodgings  mr  gardiner himself did not       expect any success from this measure  but as his brother was       eager in it  he meant to assist him in pursuing it  he added that       mr  bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london       and promised to write again very soon  there was also a       postscript to this effect          i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out  if       possible  from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment        whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be       likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself        if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability       of gaining such a clue as that  it might be of essential       consequence  at present we have nothing to guide us  colonel       forster will  i dare say  do everything in his power to satisfy       us on this head  but  on second thoughts  perhaps  lizzy could       tell us what relations he has now living  better than any other       person          elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference       to her authority proceeded  but it was not in her power to give       any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment       deserved  she had never heard of his having had any relations        except a father and mother  both of whom had been dead many       years  it was possible  however  that some of his companions in       the   shire might be able to give more information  and though       she was not very sanguine in expecting it  the application was a       something to look forward to         every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety  but the most       anxious part of each was when the post was expected  the arrival       of letters was the grand object of every morning s impatience        through letters  whatever of good or bad was to be told would be       communicated  and every succeeding day was expected to bring some       news of importance         but before they heard again from mr  gardiner  a letter arrived       for their father  from a different quarter  from mr  collins        which  as jane had received directions to open all that came for       him in his absence  she accordingly read  and elizabeth  who knew       what curiosities his letters always were  looked over her  and       read it likewise  it was as follows          my dear sir         i feel myself called upon  by our relationship  and my situation       in life  to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are       now suffering under  of which we were yesterday informed by a       letter from hertfordshire  be assured  my dear sir  that mrs        collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your       respectable family  in your present distress  which must be of       the bitterest kind  because proceeding from a cause which no time       can remove  no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can       alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you  under a       circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a       parent s mind  the death of your daughter would have been a       blessing in comparison of this  and it is the more to be       lamented  because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte       informs me  that this licentiousness of behaviour in your       daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence        though  at the same time  for the consolation of yourself and       mrs  bennet  i am inclined to think that her own disposition must       be naturally bad  or she could not be guilty of such an enormity        at so early an age  howsoever that may be  you are grievously to       be pitied  in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs  collins        but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter  to whom i have       related the affair  they agree with me in apprehending that this       false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of       all the others  for who  as lady catherine herself       condescendingly says  will connect themselves with such a family        and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect  with       augmented satisfaction  on a certain event of last november  for       had it been otherwise  i must have been involved in all your       sorrow and disgrace  let me then advise you  dear sir  to console       yourself as much as possible  to throw off your unworthy child       from your affection for ever  and leave her to reap the fruits of       her own heinous offense          i am  dear sir  etc   etc          mr  gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer       from colonel forster  and then he had nothing of a pleasant       nature to send  it was not known that wickham had a single       relationship with whom he kept up any connection  and it was       certain that he had no near one living  his former acquaintances       had been numerous  but since he had been in the militia  it did       not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any       of them  there was no one  therefore  who could be pointed out as       likely to give any news of him  and in the wretched state of his       own finances  there was a very powerful motive for secrecy  in       addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations  for it       had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a       very considerable amount  colonel forster believed that more than       a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at       brighton  he owed a good deal in town  but his debts of honour       were still more formidable  mr  gardiner did not attempt to       conceal these particulars from the longbourn family  jane heard       them with horror   a gamester   she cried   this is wholly       unexpected  i had not an idea of it          mr  gardiner added in his letter  that they might expect to see       their father at home on the following day  which was saturday        rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours        he had yielded to his brother in law s entreaty that he would       return to his family  and leave it to him to do whatever occasion       might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit  when       mrs  bennet was told of this  she did not express so much       satisfaction as her children expected  considering what her       anxiety for his life had been before          what  is he coming home  and without poor lydia   she cried         sure he will not leave london before he has found them  who is       to fight wickham  and make him marry her  if he comes away          as mrs  gardiner began to wish to be at home  it was settled that       she and the children should go to london  at the same time that       mr  bennet came from it  the coach  therefore  took them the       first stage of their journey  and brought its master back to       longbourn         mrs  gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and       her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the       world  his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them       by her niece  and the kind of half expectation which mrs        gardiner had formed  of their being followed by a letter from       him  had ended in nothing  elizabeth had received none since her       return that could come from pemberley         the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse       for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary  nothing  therefore        could be fairly conjectured from that  though elizabeth  who       was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings        was perfectly aware that  had she known nothing of darcy  she       could have borne the dread of lydia s infamy somewhat better  it       would have spared her  she thought  one sleepless night out of       two         when mr  bennet arrived  he had all the appearance of his usual       philosophic composure  he said as little as he had ever been in       the habit of saying  made no mention of the business that had       taken him away  and it was some time before his daughters had       courage to speak of it         it was not till the afternoon  when he had joined them at tea        that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject  and then  on       her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured        he replied   say nothing of that  who should suffer but myself        it has been my own doing  and i ought to feel it           you must not be too severe upon yourself   replied elizabeth          you may well warn me against such an evil  human nature is so       prone to fall into it  no  lizzy  let me once in my life feel how       much i have been to blame  i am not afraid of being overpowered       by the impression  it will pass away soon enough           do you suppose them to be in london           yes  where else can they be so well concealed           and lydia used to want to go to london   added kitty          she is happy then   said her father drily   and her residence       there will probably be of some duration          then after a short silence he continued          lizzy  i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice       to me last may  which  considering the event  shows some       greatness of mind          they were interrupted by miss bennet  who came to fetch her       mother s tea          this is a parade   he cried   which does one good  it gives such       an elegance to misfortune  another day i will do the same  i will       sit in my library  in my nightcap and powdering gown  and give as       much trouble as i can  or  perhaps  i may defer it till kitty       runs away           i am not going to run away  papa   said kitty fretfully   if i       should ever go to brighton  i would behave better than lydia           you go to brighton  i would not trust you so near it as       eastbourne for fifty pounds  no  kitty  i have at last learnt to       be cautious  and you will feel the effects of it  no officer is       ever to enter into my house again  nor even to pass through the       village  balls will be absolutely prohibited  unless you stand up       with one of your sisters  and you are never to stir out of doors       till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day       in a rational manner          kitty  who took all these threats in a serious light  began to       cry          well  well   said he   do not make yourself unhappy  if you are       a good girl for the next ten years  i will take you to a review       at the end of them               two days after mr  bennet s return  as jane and elizabeth were       walking together in the shrubbery behind the house  they saw the       housekeeper coming towards them  and  concluding that she came to       call them to their mother  went forward to meet her  but  instead       of the expected summons  when they approached her  she said to       miss bennet   i beg your pardon  madam  for interrupting you  but       i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town  so i       took the liberty of coming to ask           what do you mean  hill  we have heard nothing from town           dear madam   cried mrs  hill  in great astonishment   don t you       know there is an express come for master from mr  gardiner  he       has been here this half hour  and master has had a letter          away ran the girls  too eager to get in to have time for speech        they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room  from       thence to the library  their father was in neither  and they were       on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother  when       they were met by the butler  who said          if you are looking for my master  ma am  he is walking towards       the little copse          upon this information  they instantly passed through the hall       once more  and ran across the lawn after their father  who was       deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of       the paddock         jane  who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as       elizabeth  soon lagged behind  while her sister  panting for       breath  came up with him  and eagerly cried out          oh  papa  what news what news  have you heard from my uncle           yes i have had a letter from him by express           well  and what news does it bring good or bad           what is there of good to be expected   said he  taking the       letter from his pocket   but perhaps you would like to read it          elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand  jane now came up          read it aloud   said their father   for i hardly know myself       what it is about           gracechurch street  monday  august           my dear brother         at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece  and such       as  upon the whole  i hope it will give you satisfaction  soon       after you left me on saturday  i was fortunate enough to find out       in what part of london they were  the particulars i reserve till       we meet  it is enough to know they are discovered  i have seen       them both              then it is as i always hoped   cried jane   they are           married          elizabeth read on          i have seen them both  they are not married  nor can i find       there was any intention of being so  but if you are willing to       perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your       side  i hope it will not be long before they are  all that is       required of you is  to assure to your daughter  by settlement        her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your       children after the decease of yourself and my sister  and        moreover  to enter into an engagement of allowing her  during       your life  one hundred pounds per annum  these are conditions       which  considering everything  i had no hesitation in complying       with  as far as i thought myself privileged  for you  i shall       send this by express  that no time may be lost in bringing me       your answer  you will easily comprehend  from these particulars        that mr  wickham s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are       generally believed to be  the world has been deceived in that       respect  and i am happy to say there will be some little money        even when all his debts are discharged  to settle on my niece  in       addition to her own fortune  if  as i conclude will be the case        you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole       of this business  i will immediately give directions to       haggerston for preparing a proper settlement  there will not be       the smallest occasion for your coming to town again  therefore       stay quiet at longbourn  and depend on my diligence and care        send back your answer as fast as you can  and be careful to write       explicitly  we have judged it best that my niece should be       married from this house  of which i hope you will approve  she       comes to us to day  i shall write again as soon as anything more       is determined on  yours  etc           edw  gardiner           is it possible   cried elizabeth  when she had finished   can it       be possible that he will marry her           wickham is not so undeserving  then  as we thought him   said       her sister   my dear father  i congratulate you           and have you answered the letter   cried elizabeth          no  but it must be done soon          most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time       before he wrote          oh  my dear father   she cried   come back and write       immediately  consider how important every moment is in such a       case           let me write for you   said jane   if you dislike the trouble       yourself           i dislike it very much   he replied   but it must be done          and so saying  he turned back with them  and walked towards the       house          and may i ask   said elizabeth   but the terms  i suppose  must       be complied with           complied with  i am only ashamed of his asking so little           and they must marry  yet he is such a man           yes  yes  they must marry  there is nothing else to be done  but       there are two things that i want very much to know  one is  how       much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about  and the       other  how am i ever to pay him           money  my uncle   cried jane   what do you mean  sir           i mean  that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight       a temptation as one hundred a year during my life  and fifty       after i am gone           that is very true   said elizabeth   though it had not occurred       to me before  his debts to be discharged  and something still to       remain  oh  it must be my uncle s doings  generous  good man  i       am afraid he has distressed himself  a small sum could not do all       this           no   said her father   wickham s a fool if he takes her with a       farthing less than ten thousand pounds  i should be sorry to       think so ill of him  in the very beginning of our relationship           ten thousand pounds  heaven forbid  how is half such a sum to be       repaid          mr  bennet made no answer  and each of them  deep in thought        continued silent till they reached the house  their father then       went on to the library to write  and the girls walked into the       breakfast room          and they are really to be married   cried elizabeth  as soon as       they were by themselves   how strange this is  and for this we       are to be thankful  that they should marry  small as is their       chance of happiness  and wretched as is his character  we are       forced to rejoice  oh  lydia           i comfort myself with thinking   replied jane   that he       certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for       her  though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing       him  i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds  or anything like       it  has been advanced  he has children of his own  and may have       more  how could he spare half ten thousand pounds           if he were ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been         said elizabeth   and how much is settled on his side on our       sister  we shall exactly know what mr  gardiner has done for       them  because wickham has not sixpence of his own  the kindness       of my uncle and aunt can never be requited  their taking her       home  and affording her their personal protection and       countenance  is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of       gratitude cannot enough acknowledge  by this time she is actually       with them  if such goodness does not make her miserable now  she       will never deserve to be happy  what a meeting for her  when she       first sees my aunt           we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side         said jane   i hope and trust they will yet be happy  his       consenting to marry her is a proof  i will believe  that he is       come to a right way of thinking  their mutual affection will       steady them  and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly        and live in so rational a manner  as may in time make their past       imprudence forgotten           their conduct has been such   replied elizabeth   as neither       you  nor i  nor anybody can ever forget  it is useless to talk of       it          it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all       likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened  they went to       the library  therefore  and asked their father whether he would       not wish them to make it known to her  he was writing and        without raising his head  coolly replied          just as you please           may we take my uncle s letter to read to her           take whatever you like  and get away          elizabeth took the letter from his writing table  and they went       up stairs together  mary and kitty were both with mrs  bennet        one communication would  therefore  do for all  after a slight       preparation for good news  the letter was read aloud  mrs  bennet       could hardly contain herself  as soon as jane had read mr        gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married  her joy burst       forth  and every following sentence added to its exuberance  she       was now in an irritation as violent from delight  as she had ever       been fidgety from alarm and vexation  to know that her daughter       would be married was enough  she was disturbed by no fear for her       felicity  nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct          my dear  dear lydia   she cried   this is delightful indeed  she       will be married  i shall see her again  she will be married at       sixteen  my good  kind brother  i knew how it would be  i knew he       would manage everything  how i long to see her  and to see dear       wickham too  but the clothes  the wedding clothes  i will write       to my sister gardiner about them directly  lizzy  my dear  run       down to your father  and ask him how much he will give her  stay        stay  i will go myself  ring the bell  kitty  for hill  i will       put on my things in a moment  my dear  dear lydia  how merry we       shall be together when we meet          her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the       violence of these transports  by leading her thoughts to the       obligations which mr  gardiner s behaviour laid them all under          for we must attribute this happy conclusion   she added   in a       great measure to his kindness  we are persuaded that he has       pledged himself to assist mr  wickham with money           well   cried her mother   it is all very right  who should do it       but her own uncle  if he had not had a family of his own  i and       my children must have had all his money  you know  and it is the       first time we have ever had anything from him  except a few       presents  well  i am so happy  in a short time i shall have a       daughter married  mrs  wickham  how well it sounds  and she was       only sixteen last june  my dear jane  i am in such a flutter        that i am sure i can t write  so i will dictate  and you write       for me  we will settle with your father about the money       afterwards  but the things should be ordered immediately          she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico  muslin        and cambric  and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful       orders  had not jane  though with some difficulty  persuaded her       to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted  one day s       delay  she observed  would be of small importance  and her mother       was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual  other schemes        too  came into her head          i will go to meryton   said she   as soon as i am dressed  and       tell the good  good news to my sister philips  and as i come       back  i can call on lady lucas and mrs  long  kitty  run down and       order the carriage  an airing would do me a great deal of good  i       am sure  girls  can i do anything for you in meryton  oh  here       comes hill  my dear hill  have you heard the good news  miss       lydia is going to be married  and you shall all have a bowl of       punch to make merry at her wedding          mrs  hill began instantly to express her joy  elizabeth received       her congratulations amongst the rest  and then  sick of this       folly  took refuge in her own room  that she might think with       freedom         poor lydia s situation must  at best  be bad enough  but that it       was no worse  she had need to be thankful  she felt it so  and       though  in looking forward  neither rational happiness nor       worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister  in       looking back to what they had feared  only two hours ago  she       felt all the advantages of what they had gained              mr  bennet had very often wished before this period of his life       that  instead of spending his whole income  he had laid by an       annual sum for the better provision of his children  and of his       wife  if she survived him  he now wished it more than ever  had       he done his duty in that respect  lydia need not have been       indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now       be purchased for her  the satisfaction of prevailing on one of       the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband       might then have rested in its proper place         he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to       anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his       brother in law  and he was determined  if possible  to find out       the extent of his assistance  and to discharge the obligation as       soon as he could         when first mr  bennet had married  economy was held to be       perfectly useless  for  of course  they were to have a son  the       son was to join in cutting off the entail  as soon as he should       be of age  and the widow and younger children would by that means       be provided for  five daughters successively entered the world        but yet the son was to come  and mrs  bennet  for many years       after lydia s birth  had been certain that he would  this event       had at last been despaired of  but it was then too late to be       saving  mrs  bennet had no turn for economy  and her husband s       love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their       income         five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs        bennet and the children  but in what proportions it should be       divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents        this was one point  with regard to lydia  at least  which was now       to be settled  and mr  bennet could have no hesitation in       acceding to the proposal before him  in terms of grateful       acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother  though expressed       most concisely  he then delivered on paper his perfect       approbation of all that was done  and his willingness to fulfil       the engagements that had been made for him  he had never before       supposed that  could wickham be prevailed on to marry his       daughter  it would be done with so little inconvenience to       himself as by the present arrangement  he would scarcely be ten       pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them        for  what with her board and pocket allowance  and the continual       presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands        lydia s expenses had been very little within that sum         that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side        too  was another very welcome surprise  for his wish at present       was to have as little trouble in the business as possible  when       the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in       seeking her were over  he naturally returned to all his former       indolence  his letter was soon dispatched  for  though dilatory       in undertaking business  he was quick in its execution  he begged       to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his       brother  but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her         the good news spread quickly through the house  and with       proportionate speed through the neighbourhood  it was borne in       the latter with decent philosophy  to be sure  it would have been       more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come       upon the town  or  as the happiest alternative  been secluded       from the world  in some distant farmhouse  but there was much to       be talked of in marrying her  and the good natured wishes for her       well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old       ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this       change of circumstances  because with such an husband her misery       was considered certain         it was a fortnight since mrs  bennet had been downstairs  but on       this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table        and in spirits oppressively high  no sentiment of shame gave a       damp to her triumph  the marriage of a daughter  which had been       the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen  was now on       the point of accomplishment  and her thoughts and her words ran       wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials  fine muslins  new       carriages  and servants  she was busily searching through the       neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter  and        without knowing or considering what their income might be        rejected many as deficient in size and importance          haye park might do   said she   if the gouldings could quit       it or the great house at stoke  if the drawing room were larger        but ashworth is too far off  i could not bear to have her ten       miles from me  and as for pulvis lodge  the attics are dreadful          her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the       servants remained  but when they had withdrawn  he said to her         mrs  bennet  before you take any or all of these houses for your       son and daughter  let us come to a right understanding  into       one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have       admittance  i will not encourage the impudence of either  by       receiving them at longbourn          a long dispute followed this declaration  but mr  bennet was       firm  it soon led to another  and mrs  bennet found  with       amazement and horror  that her husband would not advance a guinea       to buy clothes for his daughter  he protested that she should       receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion        mrs  bennet could hardly comprehend it  that his anger could be       carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse       his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would       scarcely seem valid  exceeded all she could believe possible  she       was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must       reflect on her daughter s nuptials  than to any sense of shame at       her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took       place         elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had  from the       distress of the moment  been led to make mr  darcy acquainted       with their fears for her sister  for since her marriage would so       shortly give the proper termination to the elopement  they might       hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who       were not immediately on the spot         she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means  there       were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently       depended  but  at the same time  there was no one whose knowledge       of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much not        however  from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to       herself  for  at any rate  there seemed a gulf impassable between       them  had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable       terms  it was not to be supposed that mr  darcy would connect       himself with a family where  to every other objection  would now       be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a       man whom he so justly scorned         from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink        the wish of procuring her regard  which she had assured herself       of his feeling in derbyshire  could not in rational expectation       survive such a blow as this  she was humbled  she was grieved        she repented  though she hardly knew of what  she became jealous       of his esteem  when she could no longer hope to be benefited by       it  she wanted to hear of him  when there seemed the least chance       of gaining intelligence  she was convinced that she could have       been happy with him  when it was no longer likely they should       meet         what a triumph for him  as she often thought  could he know that       the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago        would now have been most gladly and gratefully received  he was       as generous  she doubted not  as the most generous of his sex        but while he was mortal  there must be a triumph         she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who  in       disposition and talents  would most suit her  his understanding       and temper  though unlike her own  would have answered all her       wishes  it was an union that must have been to the advantage of       both  by her ease and liveliness  his mind might have been       softened  his manners improved  and from his judgement        information  and knowledge of the world  she must have received       benefit of greater importance         but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude       what connubial felicity really was  an union of a different       tendency  and precluding the possibility of the other  was soon       to be formed in their family         how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable       independence  she could not imagine  but how little of permanent       happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together       because their passions were stronger than their virtue  she could       easily conjecture         mr  gardiner soon wrote again to his brother  to mr  bennet s       acknowledgments he briefly replied  with assurance of his       eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family  and       concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be       mentioned to him again  the principal purport of his letter was       to inform them that mr  wickham had resolved on quitting the       militia          it was greatly my wish that he should do so   he added   as soon       as his marriage was fixed on  and i think you will agree with me        in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable        both on his account and my niece s  it is mr  wickham s intention       to go into the regulars  and among his former friends  there are       still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army  he       has the promise of an ensigncy in general    s regiment  now       quartered in the north  it is an advantage to have it so far from       this part of the kingdom  he promises fairly  and i hope among       different people  where they may each have a character to       preserve  they will both be more prudent  i have written to       colonel forster  to inform him of our present arrangements  and       to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr        wickham in and near brighton  with assurances of speedy payment        for which i have pledged myself  and will you give yourself the       trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in       meryton  of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his       information  he has given in all his debts  i hope at least he       has not deceived us  haggerston has our directions  and all will       be completed in a week  they will then join his regiment  unless       they are first invited to longbourn  and i understand from mrs        gardiner  that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before       she leaves the south  she is well  and begs to be dutifully       remembered to you and her mother  yours  etc           e  gardiner          mr  bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s       removal from the   shire as clearly as mr  gardiner could do  but       mrs  bennet was not so well pleased with it  lydia s being       settled in the north  just when she had expected most pleasure       and pride in her company  for she had by no means given up her       plan of their residing in hertfordshire  was a severe       disappointment  and  besides  it was such a pity that lydia       should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with       everybody  and had so many favourites          she is so fond of mrs  forster   said she   it will be quite       shocking to send her away  and there are several of the young       men  too  that she likes very much  the officers may not be so       pleasant in general    s regiment          his daughter s request  for such it might be considered  of being       admitted into her family again before she set off for the north        received at first an absolute negative  but jane and elizabeth        who agreed in wishing  for the sake of their sister s feelings       and consequence  that she should be noticed on her marriage by       her parents  urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so       mildly  to receive her and her husband at longbourn  as soon as       they were married  that he was prevailed on to think as they       thought  and act as they wished  and their mother had the       satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her       married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to       the north  when mr  bennet wrote again to his brother  therefore        he sent his permission for them to come  and it was settled  that       as soon as the ceremony was over  they should proceed to       longbourn  elizabeth was surprised  however  that wickham should       consent to such a scheme  and had she consulted only her own       inclination  any meeting with him would have been the last object       of her wishes              their sister s wedding day arrived  and jane and elizabeth felt       for her probably more than she felt for herself  the carriage was       sent to meet them at     and they were to return in it by       dinner time  their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets        and jane more especially  who gave lydia the feelings which would       have attended herself  had she been the culprit  and was       wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure         they came  the family were assembled in the breakfast room to       receive them  smiles decked the face of mrs  bennet as the       carriage drove up to the door  her husband looked impenetrably       grave  her daughters  alarmed  anxious  uneasy         lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule  the door was thrown       open  and she ran into the room  her mother stepped forwards        embraced her  and welcomed her with rapture  gave her hand  with       an affectionate smile  to wickham  who followed his lady  and       wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of       their happiness         their reception from mr  bennet  to whom they then turned  was       not quite so cordial  his countenance rather gained in austerity        and he scarcely opened his lips  the easy assurance of the young       couple  indeed  was enough to provoke him  elizabeth was       disgusted  and even miss bennet was shocked  lydia was lydia       still  untamed  unabashed  wild  noisy  and fearless  she turned       from sister to sister  demanding their congratulations  and when       at length they all sat down  looked eagerly round the room  took       notice of some little alteration in it  and observed  with a       laugh  that it was a great while since she had been there         wickham was not at all more distressed than herself  but his       manners were always so pleasing  that had his character and his       marriage been exactly what they ought  his smiles and his easy       address  while he claimed their relationship  would have       delighted them all  elizabeth had not before believed him quite       equal to such assurance  but she sat down  resolving within       herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an       impudent man  she blushed  and jane blushed  but the cheeks of       the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of       colour         there was no want of discourse  the bride and her mother could       neither of them talk fast enough  and wickham  who happened to       sit near elizabeth  began enquiring after his acquaintance in       that neighbourhood  with a good humoured ease which she felt very       unable to equal in her replies  they seemed each of them to have       the happiest memories in the world  nothing of the past was       recollected with pain  and lydia led voluntarily to subjects       which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world          only think of its being three months   she cried   since i went       away  it seems but a fortnight i declare  and yet there have been       things enough happened in the time  good gracious  when i went       away  i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came       back again  though i thought it would be very good fun if i was          her father lifted up his eyes  jane was distressed  elizabeth       looked expressively at lydia  but she  who never heard nor saw       anything of which she chose to be insensible  gaily continued         oh  mamma  do the people hereabouts know i am married to day  i       was afraid they might not  and we overtook william goulding in       his curricle  so i was determined he should know it  and so i let       down the side glass next to him  and took off my glove  and let       my hand just rest upon the window frame  so that he might see the       ring  and then i bowed and smiled like anything          elizabeth could bear it no longer  she got up  and ran out of the       room  and returned no more  till she heard them passing through       the hall to the dining parlour  she then joined them soon enough       to see lydia  with anxious parade  walk up to her mother s right       hand  and hear her say to her eldest sister   ah  jane  i take       your place now  and you must go lower  because i am a married       woman          it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that       embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first        her ease and good spirits increased  she longed to see mrs        phillips  the lucases  and all their other neighbours  and to       hear herself called  mrs  wickham  by each of them  and in the       mean time  she went after dinner to show her ring  and boast of       being married  to mrs  hill and the two housemaids          well  mamma   said she  when they were all returned to the       breakfast room   and what do you think of my husband  is not he a       charming man  i am sure my sisters must all envy me  i only hope       they may have half my good luck  they must all go to brighton        that is the place to get husbands  what a pity it is  mamma  we       did not all go           very true  and if i had my will  we should  but my dear lydia  i       don t at all like your going such a way off  must it be so           oh  lord  yes  there is nothing in that  i shall like it of all       things  you and papa  and my sisters  must come down and see us        we shall be at newcastle all the winter  and i dare say there       will be some balls  and i will take care to get good partners for       them all           i should like it beyond anything   said her mother          and then when you go away  you may leave one or two of my       sisters behind you  and i dare say i shall get husbands for them       before the winter is over           i thank you for my share of the favour   said elizabeth   but i       do not particularly like your way of getting husbands          their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them  mr        wickham had received his commission before he left london  and he       was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight         no one but mrs  bennet regretted that their stay would be so       short  and she made the most of the time by visiting about with       her daughter  and having very frequent parties at home  these       parties were acceptable to all  to avoid a family circle was even       more desirable to such as did think  than such as did not         wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had       expected to find it  not equal to lydia s for him  she had       scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied  from the       reason of things  that their elopement had been brought on by the       strength of her love  rather than by his  and she would have       wondered why  without violently caring for her  he chose to elope       with her at all  had she not felt certain that his flight was       rendered necessary by distress of circumstances  and if that were       the case  he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of       having a companion         lydia was exceedingly fond of him  he was her dear wickham on       every occasion  no one was to be put in competition with him  he       did every thing best in the world  and she was sure he would kill       more birds on the first of september  than any body else in the       country         one morning  soon after their arrival  as she was sitting with       her two elder sisters  she said to elizabeth          lizzy  i never gave you an account of my wedding  i believe        you were not by  when i told mamma and the others all about it        are not you curious to hear how it was managed           no really   replied elizabeth   i think there cannot be too       little said on the subject           la  you are so strange  but i must tell you how it went off  we       were married  you know  at st  clement s  because wickham s       lodgings were in that parish  and it was settled that we should       all be there by eleven o clock  my uncle and aunt and i were to       go together  and the others were to meet us at the church  well        monday morning came  and i was in such a fuss  i was so afraid        you know  that something would happen to put it off  and then i       should have gone quite distracted  and there was my aunt  all the       time i was dressing  preaching and talking away just as if she       was reading a sermon  however  i did not hear above one word in       ten  for i was thinking  you may suppose  of my dear wickham  i       longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat           well  and so we breakfasted at ten as usual  i thought it would       never be over  for  by the bye  you are to understand  that my       uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with       them  if you ll believe me  i did not once put my foot out of       doors  though i was there a fortnight  not one party  or scheme        or anything  to be sure london was rather thin  but  however  the       little theatre was open  well  and so just as the carriage came       to the door  my uncle was called away upon business to that       horrid man mr  stone  and then  you know  when once they get       together  there is no end of it  well  i was so frightened i did       not know what to do  for my uncle was to give me away  and if we       were beyond the hour  we could not be married all day  but        luckily  he came back again in ten minutes  time  and then we all       set out  however  i recollected afterwards that if he had been       prevented going  the wedding need not be put off  for mr  darcy       might have done as well           mr  darcy   repeated elizabeth  in utter amazement          oh  yes  he was to come there with wickham  you know  but       gracious me  i quite forgot  i ought not to have said a word       about it  i promised them so faithfully  what will wickham say        it was to be such a secret           if it was to be secret   said jane   say not another word on the       subject  you may depend upon my seeking no further           oh  certainly   said elizabeth  though burning with curiosity         we will ask you no questions           thank you   said lydia   for if you did  i should certainly tell       you all  and then wickham would be angry          on such encouragement to ask  elizabeth was forced to put it out       of her power  by running away         but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible  or at       least it was impossible not to try for information  mr  darcy had       been at her sister s wedding  it was exactly a scene  and exactly       among people  where he had apparently least to do  and least       temptation to go  conjectures as to the meaning of it  rapid and       wild  hurried into her brain  but she was satisfied with none        those that best pleased her  as placing his conduct in the       noblest light  seemed most improbable  she could not bear such       suspense  and hastily seizing a sheet of paper  wrote a short       letter to her aunt  to request an explanation of what lydia had       dropt  if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been       intended          you may readily comprehend   she added   what my curiosity must       be to know how a person unconnected with any of us  and        comparatively speaking  a stranger to our family  should have       been amongst you at such a time  pray write instantly  and let me       understand it unless it is  for very cogent reasons  to remain in       the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary  and then i must       endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance           not that i shall  though   she added to herself  as she       finished the letter   and my dear aunt  if you do not tell me in       an honourable manner  i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and       stratagems to find it out          jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to       elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall  elizabeth was       glad of it  till it appeared whether her enquiries would receive       any satisfaction  she had rather be without a confidante              elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her       letter as soon as she possibly could  she was no sooner in       possession of it than  hurrying into the little copse  where she       was least likely to be interrupted  she sat down on one of the       benches and prepared to be happy  for the length of the letter       convinced her that it did not contain a denial          gracechurch street  sept            my dear niece          i have just received your letter  and shall devote this whole       morning to answering it  as i foresee that a little writing       will not comprise what i have to tell you  i must confess myself       surprised by your application  i did not expect it from you        don t think me angry  however  for i only mean to let you know       that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your       side  if you do not choose to understand me  forgive my       impertinence  your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing       but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed       him to act as he has done  but if you are really innocent and       ignorant  i must be more explicit          on the very day of my coming home from longbourn  your uncle had       a most unexpected visitor  mr  darcy called  and was shut up with       him several hours  it was all over before i arrived  so my       curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have       been  he came to tell mr  gardiner that he had found out where       your sister and mr  wickham were  and that he had seen and talked       with them both  wickham repeatedly  lydia once  from what i can       collect  he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves  and       came to town with the resolution of hunting for them  the motive       professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that       wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it       impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in       him  he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride  and       confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his       private actions open to the world  his character was to speak for       itself  he called it  therefore  his duty to step forward  and       endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself        if he had another motive  i am sure it would never disgrace       him  he had been some days in town  before he was able to       discover them  but he had something to direct his search  which       was more than we had  and the consciousness of this was another       reason for his resolving to follow us          there is a lady  it seems  a mrs  younge  who was some time ago       governess to miss darcy  and was dismissed from her charge on       some cause of disapprobation  though he did not say what  she       then took a large house in edward street  and has since       maintained herself by letting lodgings  this mrs  younge was  he       knew  intimately acquainted with wickham  and he went to her for       intelligence of him as soon as he got to town  but it was two or       three days before he could get from her what he wanted  she would       not betray her trust  i suppose  without bribery and corruption        for she really did know where her friend was to be found  wickham       indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london  and had       she been able to receive them into her house  they would have       taken up their abode with her  at length  however  our kind       friend procured the wished for direction  they were in    street        he saw wickham  and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia  his       first object with her  he acknowledged  had been to persuade her       to quit her present disgraceful situation  and return to her       friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her        offering his assistance  as far as it would go  but he found       lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was  she cared       for none of her friends  she wanted no help of his  she would not       hear of leaving wickham  she was sure they should be married some       time or other  and it did not much signify when  since such were       her feelings  it only remained  he thought  to secure and       expedite a marriage  which  in his very first conversation with       wickham  he easily learnt had never been his design  he       confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment  on account of       some debts of honour  which were very pressing  and scrupled not       to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own       folly alone  he meant to resign his commission immediately  and       as to his future situation  he could conjecture very little about       it  he must go somewhere  but he did not know where  and he knew       he should have nothing to live on          mr  darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once        though mr  bennet was not imagined to be very rich  he would have       been able to do something for him  and his situation must have       been benefited by marriage  but he found  in reply to this       question  that wickham still cherished the hope of more       effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country        under such circumstances  however  he was not likely to be proof       against the temptation of immediate relief          they met several times  for there was much to be discussed        wickham of course wanted more than he could get  but at length       was reduced to be reasonable          everything being settled between them  mr  darcy s next step       was to make your uncle acquainted with it  and he first called in       gracechurch street the evening before i came home  but mr        gardiner could not be seen  and mr  darcy found  on further       enquiry  that your father was still with him  but would quit town       the next morning  he did not judge your father to be a person       whom he could so properly consult as your uncle  and therefore       readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the       former  he did not leave his name  and till the next day it was       only known that a gentleman had called on business          on saturday he came again  your father was gone  your uncle at       home  and  as i said before  they had a great deal of talk       together          they met again on sunday  and then i saw him too  it was not       all settled before monday  as soon as it was  the express was       sent off to longbourn  but our visitor was very obstinate  i       fancy  lizzy  that obstinacy is the real defect of his character        after all  he has been accused of many faults at different times        but this is the true one  nothing was to be done that he did       not do himself  though i am sure  and i do not speak it to be       thanked  therefore say nothing about it   your uncle would most       readily have settled the whole          they battled it together for a long time  which was more than       either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved  but at       last your uncle was forced to yield  and instead of being allowed       to be of use to his niece  was forced to put up with only having       the probable credit of it  which went sorely against the grain        and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great       pleasure  because it required an explanation that would rob him       of his borrowed feathers  and give the praise where it was due        but  lizzy  this must go no farther than yourself  or jane at       most          you know pretty well  i suppose  what has been done for the       young people  his debts are to be paid  amounting  i believe  to       considerably more than a thousand pounds  another thousand in       addition to her own settled upon her  and his commission       purchased  the reason why all this was to be done by him alone        was such as i have given above  it was owing to him  to his       reserve and want of proper consideration  that wickham s       character had been so misunderstood  and consequently that he had       been received and noticed as he was  perhaps there was some truth       in this  though i doubt whether his reserve  or anybody s       reserve  can be answerable for the event  but in spite of all       this fine talking  my dear lizzy  you may rest perfectly assured       that your uncle would never have yielded  if we had not given him       credit for another interest in the affair          when all this was resolved on  he returned again to his friends        who were still staying at pemberley  but it was agreed that he       should be in london once more when the wedding took place  and       all money matters were then to receive the last finish          i believe i have now told you every thing  it is a relation       which you tell me is to give you great surprise  i hope at least       it will not afford you any displeasure  lydia came to us  and       wickham had constant admission to the house  he was exactly       what he had been  when i knew him in hertfordshire  but i would       not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour       while she staid with us  if i had not perceived  by jane s letter       last wednesday  that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a       piece with it  and therefore what i now tell you can give you no       fresh pain  i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious       manner  representing to her all the wickedness of what she had       done  and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family  if       she heard me  it was by good luck  for i am sure she did not       listen  i was sometimes quite provoked  but then i recollected my       dear elizabeth and jane  and for their sakes had patience with       her          mr  darcy was punctual in his return  and as lydia informed you        attended the wedding  he dined with us the next day  and was to       leave town again on wednesday or thursday  will you be very angry       with me  my dear lizzy  if i take this opportunity of saying        what i was never bold enough to say before  how much i like him        his behaviour to us has  in every respect  been as pleasing as       when we were in derbyshire  his understanding and opinions all       please me  he wants nothing but a little more liveliness  and       that  if he marry prudently  his wife may teach him  i       thought him very sly  he hardly ever mentioned your name  but       slyness seems the fashion          pray forgive me if i have been very presuming  or at least do       not punish me so far as to exclude me from p  i shall never be       quite happy till i have been all round the park  a low phaeton        with a nice little pair of ponies  would be the very thing          but i must write no more  the children have been wanting me this       half hour          yours  very sincerely         m  gardiner          the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of       spirits  in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure       or pain bore the greatest share  the vague and unsettled       suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr  darcy might       have been doing to forward her sister s match  which she had       feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be       probable  and at the same time dreaded to be just  from the pain       of obligation  were proved beyond their greatest extent to be       true  he had followed them purposely to town  he had taken on       himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a       research  in which supplication had been necessary to a woman       whom he must abominate and despise  and where he was reduced to       meet  frequently meet  reason with  persuade  and finally bribe        the man whom he always most wished to avoid  and whose very name       it was punishment to him to pronounce  he had done all this for a       girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem  her heart did       whisper that he had done it for her  but it was a hope shortly       checked by other considerations  and she soon felt that even her       vanity was insufficient  when required to depend on his affection       for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to       overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against       relationship with wickham  brother in law of wickham  every kind       of pride must revolt from the connection  he had  to be sure        done much  she was ashamed to think how much  but he had given a       reason for his interference  which asked no extraordinary stretch       of belief  it was reasonable that he should feel he had been       wrong  he had liberality  and he had the means of exercising it        and though she would not place herself as his principal       inducement  she could  perhaps  believe that remaining partiality       for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of       mind must be materially concerned  it was painful  exceedingly       painful  to know that they were under obligations to a person who       could never receive a return  they owed the restoration of lydia        her character  every thing  to him  oh  how heartily did she       grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged        every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him  for herself       she was humbled  but she was proud of him  proud that in a cause       of compassion and honour  he had been able to get the better of       himself  she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and       again  it was hardly enough  but it pleased her  she was even       sensible of some pleasure  though mixed with regret  on finding       how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that       affection and confidence subsisted between mr  darcy and herself         she was roused from her seat  and her reflections  by some one s       approach  and before she could strike into another path  she was       overtaken by wickham          i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble  my dear sister         said he  as he joined her          you certainly do   she replied with a smile   but it does not       follow that the interruption must be unwelcome           i should be sorry indeed  if it were  we were always good       friends  and now we are better           true  are the others coming out           i do not know  mrs  bennet and lydia are going in the carriage       to meryton  and so  my dear sister  i find  from our uncle and       aunt  that you have actually seen pemberley          she replied in the affirmative          i almost envy you the pleasure  and yet i believe it would be       too much for me  or else i could take it in my way to newcastle        and you saw the old housekeeper  i suppose  poor reynolds  she       was always very fond of me  but of course she did not mention my       name to you           yes  she did           and what did she say           that you were gone into the army  and she was afraid had not       turned out well  at such a distance as that  you know  things       are strangely misrepresented           certainly   he replied  biting his lips  elizabeth hoped she had       silenced him  but he soon afterwards said          i was surprised to see darcy in town last month  we passed each       other several times  i wonder what he can be doing there           perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh   said       elizabeth   it must be something particular  to take him there at       this time of year           undoubtedly  did you see him while you were at lambton  i       thought i understood from the gardiners that you had           yes  he introduced us to his sister           and do you like her           very much           i have heard  indeed  that she is uncommonly improved within       this year or two  when i last saw her  she was not very       promising  i am very glad you liked her  i hope she will turn out       well           i dare say she will  she has got over the most trying age           did you go by the village of kympton           i do not recollect that we did           i mention it  because it is the living which i ought to have       had  a most delightful place  excellent parsonage house  it would       have suited me in every respect           how should you have liked making sermons           exceedingly well  i should have considered it as part of my       duty  and the exertion would soon have been nothing  one ought       not to repine  but  to be sure  it would have been such a thing       for me  the quiet  the retirement of such a life would have       answered all my ideas of happiness  but it was not to be  did you       ever hear darcy mention the circumstance  when you were in kent           i have heard from authority  which i thought as good  that       it was left you conditionally only  and at the will of the       present patron           you have  yes  there was something in that  i told you so from       the first  you may remember           i did hear  too  that there was a time  when sermon making was       not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present  that you       actually declared your resolution of never taking orders  and       that the business had been compromised accordingly           you did  and it was not wholly without foundation  you may       remember what i told you on that point  when first we talked of       it          they were now almost at the door of the house  for she had walked       fast to get rid of him  and unwilling  for her sister s sake  to       provoke him  she only said in reply  with a good humoured smile          come  mr  wickham  we are brother and sister  you know  do not       let us quarrel about the past  in future  i hope we shall be       always of one mind          she held out her hand  he kissed it with affectionate gallantry        though he hardly knew how to look  and they entered the house              mr  wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation       that he never again distressed himself  or provoked his dear       sister elizabeth  by introducing the subject of it  and she was       pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet         the day of his and lydia s departure soon came  and mrs  bennet       was forced to submit to a separation  which  as her husband by no       means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle        was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth          oh  my dear lydia   she cried   when shall we meet again           oh  lord  i don t know  not these two or three years  perhaps           write to me very often  my dear           as often as i can  but you know married women have never much       time for writing  my sisters may write to me  they will have       nothing else to do          mr  wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s        he smiled  looked handsome  and said many pretty things          he is as fine a fellow   said mr  bennet  as soon as they were       out of the house   as ever i saw  he simpers  and smirks  and       makes love to us all  i am prodigiously proud of him  i defy even       sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law          the loss of her daughter made mrs  bennet very dull for several       days          i often think   said she   that there is nothing so bad as       parting with one s friends  one seems so forlorn without them           this is the consequence  you see  madam  of marrying a       daughter   said elizabeth   it must make you better satisfied       that your other four are single           it is no such thing  lydia does not leave me because she is       married  but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so       far off  if that had been nearer  she would not have gone so       soon          but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was       shortly relieved  and her mind opened again to the agitation of       hope  by an article of news which then began to be in       circulation  the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders       to prepare for the arrival of her master  who was coming down in       a day or two  to shoot there for several weeks  mrs  bennet was       quite in the fidgets  she looked at jane  and smiled and shook       her head by turns          well  well  and so mr  bingley is coming down  sister    for       mrs  phillips first brought her the news    well  so much the       better  not that i care about it  though  he is nothing to us        you know  and i am sure i never want to see him again  but        however  he is very welcome to come to netherfield  if he likes       it  and who knows what may happen  but that is nothing to us        you know  sister  we agreed long ago never to mention a word       about it  and so  is it quite certain he is coming           you may depend on it   replied the other   for mrs  nicholls was       in meryton last night  i saw her passing by  and went out myself       on purpose to know the truth of it  and she told me that it was       certain true  he comes down on thursday at the latest  very       likely on wednesday  she was going to the butcher s  she told me        on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday  and she has got       three couple of ducks just fit to be killed          miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without       changing colour  it was many months since she had mentioned his       name to elizabeth  but now  as soon as they were alone together        she said          i saw you look at me to day  lizzy  when my aunt told us of the       present report  and i know i appeared distressed  but don t       imagine it was from any silly cause  i was only confused for the       moment  because i felt that i should be looked at  i do assure       you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or       pain  i am glad of one thing  that he comes alone  because we       shall see the less of him  not that i am afraid of myself  but       i dread other people s remarks          elizabeth did not know what to make of it  had she not seen him       in derbyshire  she might have supposed him capable of coming       there with no other view than what was acknowledged  but she       still thought him partial to jane  and she wavered as to the       greater probability of his coming there with his friend s       permission  or being bold enough to come without it          yet it is hard   she sometimes thought   that this poor man       cannot come to a house which he has legally hired  without       raising all this speculation  i will leave him to himself          in spite of what her sister declared  and really believed to be       her feelings in the expectation of his arrival  elizabeth could       easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it  they were       more disturbed  more unequal  than she had often seen them         the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their       parents  about a twelvemonth ago  was now brought forward again          as soon as ever mr  bingley comes  my dear   said mrs  bennet         you will wait on him of course           no  no  you forced me into visiting him last year  and promised        if i went to see him  he should marry one of my daughters  but it       ended in nothing  and i will not be sent on a fool s errand       again          his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an       attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen  on his       returning to netherfield           tis an etiquette i despise   said he   if he wants our       society  let him seek it  he knows where we live  i will not       spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they       go away and come back again           well  all i know is  that it will be abominably rude if you do       not wait on him  but  however  that shan t prevent my asking him       to dine here  i am determined  we must have mrs  long and the       gouldings soon  that will make thirteen with ourselves  so there       will be just room at table for him          consoled by this resolution  she was the better able to bear her       husband s incivility  though it was very mortifying to know that       her neighbours might all see mr  bingley  in consequence of it        before they did  as the day of his arrival drew near           i begin to be sorry that he comes at all   said jane to her       sister   it would be nothing  i could see him with perfect       indifference  but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually       talked of  my mother means well  but she does not know  no one       can know  how much i suffer from what she says  happy shall i be        when his stay at netherfield is over           i wish i could say anything to comfort you   replied elizabeth         but it is wholly out of my power  you must feel it  and the       usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied       me  because you have always so much          mr  bingley arrived  mrs  bennet  through the assistance of       servants  contrived to have the earliest tidings of it  that the       period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as       it could  she counted the days that must intervene before their       invitation could be sent  hopeless of seeing him before  but on       the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire  she saw       him  from her dressing room window  enter the paddock and ride       towards the house         her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy  jane       resolutely kept her place at the table  but elizabeth  to satisfy       her mother  went to the window she looked  she saw mr  darcy with       him  and sat down again by her sister          there is a gentleman with him  mamma   said kitty   who can it       be           some acquaintance or other  my dear  i suppose  i am sure i do       not know           la   replied kitty   it looks just like that man that used to be       with him before  mr  what s his name  that tall  proud man           good gracious  mr  darcy  and so it does  i vow  well  any       friend of mr  bingley s will always be welcome here  to be sure        but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him          jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern  she knew but       little of their meeting in derbyshire  and therefore felt for the       awkwardness which must attend her sister  in seeing him almost       for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter  both       sisters were uncomfortable enough  each felt for the other  and       of course for themselves  and their mother talked on  of her       dislike of mr  darcy  and her resolution to be civil to him only       as mr  bingley s friend  without being heard by either of them        but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be       suspected by jane  to whom she had never yet had courage to shew       mrs  gardiner s letter  or to relate her own change of sentiment       towards him  to jane  he could be only a man whose proposals she       had refused  and whose merit she had undervalued  but to her own       more extensive information  he was the person to whom the whole       family were indebted for the first of benefits  and whom she       regarded herself with an interest  if not quite so tender  at       least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley  her       astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield  to       longbourn  and voluntarily seeking her again  was almost equal to       what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in       derbyshire         the colour which had been driven from her face  returned for half       a minute with an additional glow  and a smile of delight added       lustre to her eyes  as she thought for that space of time that       his affection and wishes must still be unshaken  but she would       not be secure          let me first see how he behaves   said she   it will then be       early enough for expectation          she sat intently at work  striving to be composed  and without       daring to lift up her eyes  till anxious curiosity carried them       to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the       door  jane looked a little paler than usual  but more sedate than       elizabeth had expected  on the gentlemen s appearing  her colour       increased  yet she received them with tolerable ease  and with a       propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of       resentment or any unnecessary complaisance         elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow  and       sat down again to her work  with an eagerness which it did not       often command  she had ventured only one glance at darcy  he       looked serious  as usual  and  she thought  more as he had been       used to look in hertfordshire  than as she had seen him at       pemberley  but  perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be       what he was before her uncle and aunt  it was a painful  but not       an improbable  conjecture         bingley  she had likewise seen for an instant  and in that short       period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed  he was       received by mrs  bennet with a degree of civility which made her       two daughters ashamed  especially when contrasted with the cold       and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his       friend         elizabeth  particularly  who knew that her mother owed to the       latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from       irremediable infamy  was hurt and distressed to a most painful       degree by a distinction so ill applied         darcy  after enquiring of her how mr  and mrs  gardiner did  a       question which she could not answer without confusion  said       scarcely anything  he was not seated by her  perhaps that was the       reason of his silence  but it had not been so in derbyshire        there he had talked to her friends  when he could not to herself        but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his       voice  and when occasionally  unable to resist the impulse of       curiosity  she raised her eyes to his face  she as often found       him looking at jane as at herself  and frequently on no object       but the ground  more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please        than when they last met  were plainly expressed  she was       disappointed  and angry with herself for being so          could i expect it to be otherwise   said she   yet why did he       come          she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself        and to him she had hardly courage to speak         she enquired after his sister  but could do no more          it is a long time  mr  bingley  since you went away   said mrs        bennet         he readily agreed to it          i began to be afraid you would never come back again  people       did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas        but  however  i hope it is not true  a great many changes have       happened in the neighbourhood  since you went away  miss lucas is       married and settled  and one of my own daughters  i suppose you       have heard of it  indeed  you must have seen it in the papers  it       was in the times and the courier  i know  though it was not put       in as it ought to be  it was only said   lately  george wickham        esq  to miss lydia bennet   without there being a syllable said       of her father  or the place where she lived  or anything  it was       my brother gardiner s drawing up too  and i wonder how he came to       make such an awkward business of it  did you see it          bingley replied that he did  and made his congratulations        elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes  how mr  darcy looked        therefore  she could not tell          it is a delightful thing  to be sure  to have a daughter well       married   continued her mother   but at the same time  mr        bingley  it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me        they are gone down to newcastle  a place quite northward  it       seems  and there they are to stay i do not know how long  his       regiment is there  for i suppose you have heard of his leaving       the   shire  and of his being gone into the regulars  thank       heaven  he has some friends  though perhaps not so many as he       deserves          elizabeth  who knew this to be levelled at mr  darcy  was in such       misery of shame  that she could hardly keep her seat  it drew       from her  however  the exertion of speaking  which nothing else       had so effectually done before  and she asked bingley whether he       meant to make any stay in the country at present  a few weeks  he       believed          when you have killed all your own birds  mr  bingley   said her       mother   i beg you will come here  and shoot as many as you       please on mr  bennet s manor  i am sure he will be vastly happy       to oblige you  and will save all the best of the covies for you          elizabeth s misery increased  at such unnecessary  such officious       attention  were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had       flattered them a year ago  every thing  she was persuaded  would       be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion  at that instant        she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself       amends for moments of such painful confusion          the first wish of my heart   said she to herself   is never more       to be in company with either of them  their society can afford no       pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this  let me       never see either one or the other again          yet the misery  for which years of happiness were to offer no       compensation  received soon afterwards material relief  from       observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the       admiration of her former lover  when first he came in  he had       spoken to her but little  but every five minutes seemed to be       giving her more of his attention  he found her as handsome as she       had been last year  as good natured  and as unaffected  though       not quite so chatty  jane was anxious that no difference should       be perceived in her at all  and was really persuaded that she       talked as much as ever  but her mind was so busily engaged  that       she did not always know when she was silent         when the gentlemen rose to go away  mrs  bennet was mindful of       her intended civility  and they were invited and engaged to dine       at longbourn in a few days time          you are quite a visit in my debt  mr  bingley   she added   for       when you went to town last winter  you promised to take a family       dinner with us  as soon as you returned  i have not forgot  you       see  and i assure you  i was very much disappointed that you did       not come back and keep your engagement          bingley looked a little silly at this reflection  and said       something of his concern at having been prevented by business        they then went away         mrs  bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and       dine there that day  but  though she always kept a very good       table  she did not think anything less than two courses could be       good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs  or       satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a       year              as soon as they were gone  elizabeth walked out to recover her       spirits  or in other words  to dwell without interruption on       those subjects that must deaden them more  mr  darcy s behaviour       astonished and vexed her          why  if he came only to be silent  grave  and indifferent   said       she   did he come at all          she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure          he could be still amiable  still pleasing  to my uncle and aunt        when he was in town  and why not to me  if he fears me  why come       hither  if he no longer cares for me  why silent  teasing        teasing  man  i will think no more about him          her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the       approach of her sister  who joined her with a cheerful look        which showed her better satisfied with their visitors  than       elizabeth          now   said she   that this first meeting is over  i feel       perfectly easy  i know my own strength  and i shall never be       embarrassed again by his coming  i am glad he dines here on       tuesday  it will then be publicly seen that  on both sides  we       meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance           yes  very indifferent indeed   said elizabeth  laughingly   oh        jane  take care           my dear lizzy  you cannot think me so weak  as to be in danger       now           i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in       love with you as ever          they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday  and mrs        bennet  in the meanwhile  was giving way to all the happy       schemes  which the good humour and common politeness of bingley        in half an hour s visit  had revived         on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn  and       the two who were most anxiously expected  to the credit of their       punctuality as sportsmen  were in very good time  when they       repaired to the dining room  elizabeth eagerly watched to see       whether bingley would take the place  which  in all their former       parties  had belonged to him  by her sister  her prudent mother        occupied by the same ideas  forbore to invite him to sit by       herself  on entering the room  he seemed to hesitate  but jane       happened to look round  and happened to smile  it was decided  he       placed himself by her         elizabeth  with a triumphant sensation  looked towards his       friend  he bore it with noble indifference  and she would have       imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy  had       she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr  darcy  with an       expression of half laughing alarm         his behaviour to her sister was such  during dinner time  as       showed an admiration of her  which  though more guarded than       formerly  persuaded elizabeth  that if left wholly to himself        jane s happiness  and his own  would be speedily secured  though       she dared not depend upon the consequence  she yet received       pleasure from observing his behaviour  it gave her all the       animation that her spirits could boast  for she was in no       cheerful humour  mr  darcy was almost as far from her as the       table could divide them  he was on one side of her mother  she       knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either        or make either appear to advantage  she was not near enough to       hear any of their discourse  but she could see how seldom they       spoke to each other  and how formal and cold was their manner       whenever they did  her mother s ungraciousness  made the sense of       what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind  and she       would  at times  have given anything to be privileged to tell him       that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of       the family         she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity       of bringing them together  that the whole of the visit would not       pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of       conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his       entrance  anxious and uneasy  the period which passed in the       drawing room  before the gentlemen came  was wearisome and dull       to a degree that almost made her uncivil  she looked forward to       their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure       for the evening must depend          if he does not come to me  then   said she   i shall give him       up for ever          the gentlemen came  and she thought he looked as if he would have       answered her hopes  but  alas  the ladies had crowded round the       table  where miss bennet was making tea  and elizabeth pouring       out the coffee  in so close a confederacy that there was not a       single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair  and on the       gentlemen s approaching  one of the girls moved closer to her       than ever  and said  in a whisper          the men shan t come and part us  i am determined  we want none       of them  do we          darcy had walked away to another part of the room  she followed       him with her eyes  envied everyone to whom he spoke  had scarcely       patience enough to help anybody to coffee  and then was enraged       against herself for being so silly          a man who has once been refused  how could i ever be foolish       enough to expect a renewal of his love  is there one among the       sex  who would not protest against such a weakness as a second       proposal to the same woman  there is no indignity so abhorrent to       their feelings          she was a little revived  however  by his bringing back his       coffee cup himself  and she seized the opportunity of saying          is your sister at pemberley still           yes  she will remain there till christmas           and quite alone  have all her friends left her           mrs  annesley is with her  the others have been gone on to       scarborough  these three weeks          she could think of nothing more to say  but if he wished to       converse with her  he might have better success  he stood by her        however  for some minutes  in silence  and  at last  on the young       lady s whispering to elizabeth again  he walked away         when the tea things were removed  and the card tables placed  the       ladies all rose  and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined       by him  when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a       victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players  and in a few       moments after seated with the rest of the party  she now lost       every expectation of pleasure  they were confined for the evening       at different tables  and she had nothing to hope  but that his       eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room  as to       make him play as unsuccessfully as herself         mrs  bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to       supper  but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of       the others  and she had no opportunity of detaining them          well girls   said she  as soon as they were left to themselves         what say you to the day  i think every thing has passed off       uncommonly well  i assure you  the dinner was as well dressed as       any i ever saw  the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody       said they never saw so fat a haunch  the soup was fifty times       better than what we had at the lucases  last week  and even mr        darcy acknowledged  that the partridges were remarkably well       done  and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least        and  my dear jane  i never saw you look in greater beauty  mrs        long said so too  for i asked her whether you did not  and what       do you think she said besides   ah  mrs  bennet  we shall have       her at netherfield at last   she did indeed  i do think mrs  long       is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very       pretty behaved girls  and not at all handsome  i like them       prodigiously          mrs  bennet  in short  was in very great spirits  she had seen       enough of bingley s behaviour to jane  to be convinced that she       would get him at last  and her expectations of advantage to her       family  when in a happy humour  were so far beyond reason  that       she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next       day  to make his proposals          it has been a very agreeable day   said miss bennet to       elizabeth   the party seemed so well selected  so suitable one       with the other  i hope we may often meet again          elizabeth smiled          lizzy  you must not do so  you must not suspect me  it mortifies       me  i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation       as an agreeable and sensible young man  without having a wish       beyond it  i am perfectly satisfied  from what his manners now       are  that he never had any design of engaging my affection  it is       only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address  and a       stronger desire of generally pleasing  than any other man           you are very cruel   said her sister   you will not let me       smile  and are provoking me to it every moment           how hard it is in some cases to be believed           and how impossible in others           but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i       acknowledge           that is a question which i hardly know how to answer  we all       love to instruct  though we can teach only what is not worth       knowing  forgive me  and if you persist in indifference  do not       make me your confidante               a few days after this visit  mr  bingley called again  and alone        his friend had left him that morning for london  but was to       return home in ten days time  he sat with them above an hour  and       was in remarkably good spirits  mrs  bennet invited him to dine       with them  but  with many expressions of concern  he confessed       himself engaged elsewhere          next time you call   said she   i hope we shall be more lucky          he should be particularly happy at any time  etc  etc   and if       she would give him leave  would take an early opportunity of       waiting on them          can you come to morrow          yes  he had no engagement at all for to morrow  and her       invitation was accepted with alacrity         he came  and in such very good time that the ladies were none of       them dressed  in ran mrs  bennet to her daughter s room  in her       dressing gown  and with her hair half finished  crying out          my dear jane  make haste and hurry down  he is come mr  bingley       is come  he is  indeed  make haste  make haste  here  sarah  come       to miss bennet this moment  and help her on with her gown  never       mind miss lizzy s hair           we will be down as soon as we can   said jane   but i dare say       kitty is forwarder than either of us  for she went up stairs half       an hour ago           oh  hang kitty  what has she to do with it  come be quick  be       quick  where is your sash  my dear          but when her mother was gone  jane would not be prevailed on to       go down without one of her sisters         the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in       the evening  after tea  mr  bennet retired to the library  as was       his custom  and mary went up stairs to her instrument  two       obstacles of the five being thus removed  mrs  bennet sat looking       and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time        without making any impression on them  elizabeth would not       observe her  and when at last kitty did  she very innocently       said   what is the matter mamma  what do you keep winking at me       for  what am i to do           nothing child  nothing  i did not wink at you   she then sat       still five minutes longer  but unable to waste such a precious       occasion  she suddenly got up  and saying to kitty   come here        my love  i want to speak to you   took her out of the room  jane       instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at       such premeditation  and her entreaty that she would not give in       to it  in a few minutes  mrs  bennet half opened the door and       called out          lizzy  my dear  i want to speak with you          elizabeth was forced to go          we may as well leave them by themselves you know   said her       mother  as soon as she was in the hall   kitty and i are going up       stairs to sit in my dressing room          elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother  but remained       quietly in the hall  till she and kitty were out of sight  then       returned into the drawing room         mrs  bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual  bingley was       every thing that was charming  except the professed lover of her       daughter  his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable       addition to their evening party  and he bore with the ill judged       officiousness of the mother  and heard all her silly remarks with       a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to       the daughter         he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper  and before he       went away  an engagement was formed  chiefly through his own and       mrs  bennet s means  for his coming next morning to shoot with       her husband         after this day  jane said no more of her indifference  not a word       passed between the sisters concerning bingley  but elizabeth went       to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded        unless mr  darcy returned within the stated time  seriously        however  she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have       taken place with that gentleman s concurrence         bingley was punctual to his appointment  and he and mr  bennet       spent the morning together  as had been agreed on  the latter was       much more agreeable than his companion expected  there was       nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his       ridicule  or disgust him into silence  and he was more       communicative  and less eccentric  than the other had ever seen       him  bingley of course returned with him to dinner  and in the       evening mrs  bennet s invention was again at work to get every       body away from him and her daughter  elizabeth  who had a letter       to write  went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon       after tea  for as the others were all going to sit down to cards        she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes         but on returning to the drawing room  when her letter was       finished  she saw  to her infinite surprise  there was reason to       fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her  on opening       the door  she perceived her sister and bingley standing together       over the hearth  as if engaged in earnest conversation  and had       this led to no suspicion  the faces of both  as they hastily       turned round and moved away from each other  would have told it       all  their situation was awkward enough  but hers she thought       was still worse  not a syllable was uttered by either  and       elizabeth was on the point of going away again  when bingley  who       as well as the other had sat down  suddenly rose  and whispering       a few words to her sister  ran out of the room         jane could have no reserves from elizabeth  where confidence       would give pleasure  and instantly embracing her  acknowledged        with the liveliest emotion  that she was the happiest creature in       the world           tis too much   she added   by far too much  i do not deserve       it  oh  why is not everybody as happy          elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity  a       warmth  a delight  which words could but poorly express  every       sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane  but       she would not allow herself to stay with her sister  or say half       that remained to be said for the present          i must go instantly to my mother   she cried   i would not on       any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude  or allow her       to hear it from anyone but myself  he is gone to my father       already  oh  lizzy  to know that what i have to relate will give       such pleasure to all my dear family  how shall i bear so much       happiness          she then hastened away to her mother  who had purposely broken up       the card party  and was sitting up stairs with kitty         elizabeth  who was left by herself  now smiled at the rapidity       and ease with which an affair was finally settled  that had given       them so many previous months of suspense and vexation          and this   said she   is the end of all his friend s anxious       circumspection  of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance        the happiest  wisest  most reasonable end          in a few minutes she was joined by bingley  whose conference with       her father had been short and to the purpose          where is your sister   said he hastily  as he opened the door          with my mother up stairs  she will be down in a moment  i dare       say          he then shut the door  and  coming up to her  claimed the good       wishes and affection of a sister  elizabeth honestly and heartily       expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship  they       shook hands with great cordiality  and then  till her sister came       down  she had to listen to all he had to say of his own       happiness  and of jane s perfections  and in spite of his being a       lover  elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity       to be rationally founded  because they had for basis the       excellent understanding  and super excellent disposition of jane        and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and       himself         it was an evening of no common delight to them all  the       satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet       animation to her face  as made her look handsomer than ever        kitty simpered and smiled  and hoped her turn was coming soon        mrs  bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation       in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings  though she talked       to bingley of nothing else for half an hour  and when mr  bennet       joined them at supper  his voice and manner plainly showed how       really happy he was         not a word  however  passed his lips in allusion to it  till       their visitor took his leave for the night  but as soon as he was       gone  he turned to his daughter  and said          jane  i congratulate you  you will be a very happy woman          jane went to him instantly  kissed him  and thanked him for his       goodness          you are a good girl   he replied   and i have great pleasure in       thinking you will be so happily settled  i have not a doubt of       your doing very well together  your tempers are by no means       unlike  you are each of you so complying  that nothing will ever       be resolved on  so easy  that every servant will cheat you  and       so generous  that you will always exceed your income           i hope not so  imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters       would be unpardonable in me           exceed their income  my dear mr  bennet   cried his wife   what       are you talking of  why  he has four or five thousand a year  and       very likely more   then addressing her daughter   oh  my dear        dear jane  i am so happy  i am sure i shan t get a wink of sleep       all night  i knew how it would be  i always said it must be so        at last  i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing  i       remember  as soon as ever i saw him  when he first came into       hertfordshire last year  i thought how likely it was that you       should come together  oh  he is the handsomest young man that       ever was seen          wickham  lydia  were all forgotten  jane was beyond competition       her favourite child  at that moment  she cared for no other  her       younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects       of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense         mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield  and       kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter         bingley  from this time  was of course a daily visitor at       longbourn  coming frequently before breakfast  and always       remaining till after supper  unless when some barbarous       neighbour  who could not be enough detested  had given him an       invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept         elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her       sister  for while he was present  jane had no attention to bestow       on anyone else  but she found herself considerably useful to both       of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur        in the absence of jane  he always attached himself to elizabeth        for the pleasure of talking of her  and when bingley was gone        jane constantly sought the same means of relief          he has made me so happy   said she  one evening   by telling me       that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring  i       had not believed it possible           i suspected as much   replied elizabeth   but how did he account       for it           it must have been his sister s doing  they were certainly no       friends to his acquaintance with me  which i cannot wonder at        since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many       respects  but when they see  as i trust they will  that their       brother is happy with me  they will learn to be contented  and we       shall be on good terms again  though we can never be what we once       were to each other           that is the most unforgiving speech   said elizabeth   that i       ever heard you utter  good girl  it would vex me  indeed  to see       you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard           would you believe it  lizzy  that when he went to town last       november  he really loved me  and nothing but a persuasion of       my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down       again           he made a little mistake to be sure  but it is to the credit of       his modesty          this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his       diffidence  and the little value he put on his own good       qualities  elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed       the interference of his friend  for  though jane had the most       generous and forgiving heart in the world  she knew it was a       circumstance which must prejudice her against him          i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed         cried jane   oh  lizzy  why am i thus singled from my family  and       blessed above them all  if i could but see you as happy  if there       were but such another man for you           if you were to give me forty such men  i never could be so happy       as you  till i have your disposition  your goodness  i never can       have your happiness  no  no  let me shift for myself  and        perhaps  if i have very good luck  i may meet with another mr        collins in time          the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be       long a secret  mrs  bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs        phillips  and she ventured  without any permission  to do the       same by all her neighbours in meryton         the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in       the world  though only a few weeks before  when lydia had first       run away  they had been generally proved to be marked out for       misfortune              one morning  about a week after bingley s engagement with jane       had been formed  as he and the females of the family were sitting       together in the dining room  their attention was suddenly drawn       to the window  by the sound of a carriage  and they perceived a       chaise and four driving up the lawn  it was too early in the       morning for visitors  and besides  the equipage did not answer to       that of any of their neighbours  the horses were post  and       neither the carriage  nor the livery of the servant who preceded       it  were familiar to them  as it was certain  however  that       somebody was coming  bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet       to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion  and walk away with       him into the shrubbery  they both set off  and the conjectures of       the remaining three continued  though with little satisfaction        till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered  it was       lady catherine de bourgh         they were of course all intending to be surprised  but their       astonishment was beyond their expectation  and on the part of       mrs  bennet and kitty  though she was perfectly unknown to them        even inferior to what elizabeth felt         she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious        made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight       inclination of the head  and sat down without saying a word        elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s       entrance  though no request of introduction had been made         mrs  bennet  all amazement  though flattered by having a guest of       such high importance  received her with the utmost politeness        after sitting for a moment in silence  she said very stiffly to       elizabeth          i hope you are well  miss bennet  that lady  i suppose  is your       mother          elizabeth replied very concisely that she was          and that i suppose is one of your sisters           yes  madam   said mrs  bennet  delighted to speak to lady       catherine   she is my youngest girl but one  my youngest of all       is lately married  and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds        walking with a young man who  i believe  will soon become a part       of the family           you have a very small park here   returned lady catherine after       a short silence          it is nothing in comparison of rosings  my lady  i dare say  but       i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas s           this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening        in summer  the windows are full west          mrs  bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner        and then added          may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left       mr  and mrs  collins well           yes  very well  i saw them the night before last          elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her       from charlotte  as it seemed the only probable motive for her       calling  but no letter appeared  and she was completely puzzled         mrs  bennet  with great civility  begged her ladyship to take       some refreshment  but lady catherine very resolutely  and not       very politely  declined eating anything  and then  rising up        said to elizabeth          miss bennet  there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little       wilderness on one side of your lawn  i should be glad to take a       turn in it  if you will favour me with your company           go  my dear   cried her mother   and show her ladyship about the       different walks  i think she will be pleased with the hermitage          elizabeth obeyed  and running into her own room for her parasol        attended her noble guest downstairs  as they passed through the       hall  lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and       drawing room  and pronouncing them  after a short survey  to be       decent looking rooms  walked on         her carriage remained at the door  and elizabeth saw that her       waiting woman was in it  they proceeded in silence along the       gravel walk that led to the copse  elizabeth was determined to       make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more       than usually insolent and disagreeable          how could i ever think her like her nephew   said she  as she       looked in her face         as soon as they entered the copse  lady catherine began in the       following manner           you can be at no loss  miss bennet  to understand the reason of       my journey hither  your own heart  your own conscience  must tell       you why i come          elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment          indeed  you are mistaken  madam  i have not been at all able to       account for the honour of seeing you here           miss bennet   replied her ladyship  in an angry tone   you ought       to know  that i am not to be trifled with  but however insincere       you may choose to be  you shall not find me so  my character       has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness  and in       a cause of such moment as this  i shall certainly not depart from       it  a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago  i       was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most       advantageously married  but that you  that miss elizabeth bennet        would  in all likelihood  be soon afterwards united to my nephew        my own nephew  mr  darcy  though i know it must be a scandalous       falsehood  though i would not injure him so much as to suppose       the truth of it possible  i instantly resolved on setting off for       this place  that i might make my sentiments known to you           if you believed it impossible to be true   said elizabeth        colouring with astonishment and disdain   i wonder you took the       trouble of coming so far  what could your ladyship propose by       it           at once to insist upon having such a report universally       contradicted           your coming to longbourn  to see me and my family   said       elizabeth coolly   will be rather a confirmation of it  if        indeed  such a report is in existence           if  do you then pretend to be ignorant of it  has it not been       industriously circulated by yourselves  do you not know that such       a report is spread abroad           i never heard that it was           and can you likewise declare  that there is no foundation for       it           i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship        you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer           this is not to be borne  miss bennet  i insist on being       satisfied  has he  has my nephew  made you an offer of marriage           your ladyship has declared it to be impossible           it ought to be so  it must be so  while he retains the use of       his reason  but your arts and allurements may  in a moment of       infatuation  have made him forget what he owes to himself and to       all his family  you may have drawn him in           if i have  i shall be the last person to confess it           miss bennet  do you know who i am  i have not been accustomed to       such language as this  i am almost the nearest relation he has in       the world  and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns           but you are not entitled to know mine  nor will such behaviour       as this  ever induce me to be explicit           let me be rightly understood  this match  to which you have the       presumption to aspire  can never take place  no  never  mr  darcy       is engaged to my daughter  now what have you to say           only this  that if he is so  you can have no reason to suppose       he will make an offer to me          lady catherine hesitated for a moment  and then replied          the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind  from their       infancy  they have been intended for each other  it was the       favourite wish of his mother  as well as of hers  while in       their cradles  we planned the union  and now  at the moment when       the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their       marriage  to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth  of       no importance in the world  and wholly unallied to the family  do       you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends  to his tacit       engagement with miss de bourgh  are you lost to every feeling of       propriety and delicacy  have you not heard me say that from his       earliest hours he was destined for his cousin           yes  and i had heard it before  but what is that to me  if there       is no other objection to my marrying your nephew  i shall       certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt       wished him to marry miss de bourgh  you both did as much as you       could in planning the marriage  its completion depended on       others  if mr  darcy is neither by honour nor inclination       confined to his cousin  why is not he to make another choice  and       if i am that choice  why may not i accept him           because honour  decorum  prudence  nay  interest  forbid it        yes  miss bennet  interest  for do not expect to be noticed by       his family or friends  if you wilfully act against the       inclinations of all  you will be censured  slighted  and       despised  by everyone connected with him  your alliance will be a       disgrace  your name will never even be mentioned by any of us           these are heavy misfortunes   replied elizabeth   but the wife       of mr  darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness       necessarily attached to her situation  that she could  upon the       whole  have no cause to repine           obstinate  headstrong girl  i am ashamed of you  is this your       gratitude for my attentions to you last spring  is nothing due to       me on that score  let us sit down  you are to understand  miss       bennet  that i came here with the determined resolution of       carrying my purpose  nor will i be dissuaded from it  i have not       been used to submit to any person s whims  i have not been in the       habit of brooking disappointment           that will make your ladyship s situation at present more       pitiable  but it will have no effect on me           i will not be interrupted  hear me in silence  my daughter and       my nephew are formed for each other  they are descended  on the       maternal side  from the same noble line  and  on the father s        from respectable  honourable  and ancient though       untitled families  their fortune on both sides is splendid  they       are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their       respective houses  and what is to divide them  the upstart       pretensions of a young woman without family  connections  or       fortune  is this to be endured  but it must not  shall not be  if       you were sensible of your own good  you would not wish to quit       the sphere in which you have been brought up           in marrying your nephew  i should not consider myself as       quitting that sphere  he is a gentleman  i am a gentleman s       daughter  so far we are equal           true  you are a gentleman s daughter  but who was your mother        who are your uncles and aunts  do not imagine me ignorant of       their condition           whatever my connections may be   said elizabeth   if your nephew       does not object to them  they can be nothing to you           tell me once for all  are you engaged to him          though elizabeth would not  for the mere purpose of obliging lady       catherine  have answered this question  she could not but say        after a moment s deliberation          i am not          lady catherine seemed pleased          and will you promise me  never to enter into such an       engagement           i will make no promise of the kind           miss bennet i am shocked and astonished  i expected to find a       more reasonable young woman  but do not deceive yourself into a       belief that i will ever recede  i shall not go away till you have       given me the assurance i require           and i certainly never shall give it  i am not to be       intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable  your ladyship       wants mr  darcy to marry your daughter  but would my giving you       the wished for promise make their marriage at all more       probable  supposing him to be attached to me  would my refusing       to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin        allow me to say  lady catherine  that the arguments with which       you have supported this extraordinary application have been as       frivolous as the application was ill judged  you have widely       mistaken my character  if you think i can be worked on by such       persuasions as these  how far your nephew might approve of your       interference in his affairs  i cannot tell  but you have       certainly no right to concern yourself in mine  i must beg        therefore  to be importuned no farther on the subject           not so hasty  if you please  i have by no means done  to all the       objections i have already urged  i have still another to add  i       am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s       infamous elopement  i know it all  that the young man s marrying       her was a patched up business  at the expence of your father and       uncles  and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister  is her       husband  who is the son of his late father s steward  to be his       brother  heaven and earth  of what are you thinking  are the       shades of pemberley to be thus polluted           you can now have nothing further to say   she resentfully       answered   you have insulted me in every possible method  i must       beg to return to the house          and she rose as she spoke  lady catherine rose also  and they       turned back  her ladyship was highly incensed          you have no regard  then  for the honour and credit of my       nephew  unfeeling  selfish girl  do you not consider that a       connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody           lady catherine  i have nothing further to say  you know my       sentiments           you are then resolved to have him           i have said no such thing  i am only resolved to act in that       manner  which will  in my own opinion  constitute my happiness        without reference to you  or to any person so wholly       unconnected with me           it is well  you refuse  then  to oblige me  you refuse to obey       the claims of duty  honour  and gratitude  you are determined to       ruin him in the opinion of all his friends  and make him the       contempt of the world           neither duty  nor honour  nor gratitude   replied elizabeth         have any possible claim on me  in the present instance  no       principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr        darcy  and with regard to the resentment of his family  or the       indignation of the world  if the former were excited by his       marrying me  it would not give me one moment s concern and the       world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn           and this is your real opinion  this is your final resolve  very       well  i shall now know how to act  do not imagine  miss bennet        that your ambition will ever be gratified  i came to try you  i       hoped to find you reasonable  but  depend upon it  i will carry       my point          in this manner lady catherine talked on  till they were at the       door of the carriage  when  turning hastily round  she added   i       take no leave of you  miss bennet  i send no compliments to your       mother  you deserve no such attention  i am most seriously       displeased          elizabeth made no answer  and without attempting to persuade her       ladyship to return into the house  walked quietly into it       herself  she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up       stairs  her mother impatiently met her at the door of the       dressing room  to ask why lady catherine would not come in again       and rest herself          she did not choose it   said her daughter   she would go           she is a very fine looking woman  and her calling here was       prodigiously civil  for she only came  i suppose  to tell us the       collinses were well  she is on her road somewhere  i dare say        and so  passing through meryton  thought she might as well call       on you  i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you        lizzy          elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here  for to       acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible              the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw       elizabeth into  could not be easily overcome  nor could she  for       many hours  learn to think of it less than incessantly  lady       catherine  it appeared  had actually taken the trouble of this       journey from rosings  for the sole purpose of breaking off her       supposed engagement with mr  darcy  it was a rational scheme  to       be sure  but from what the report of their engagement could       originate  elizabeth was at a loss to imagine  till she       recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley  and       her being the sister of jane  was enough  at a time when the       expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another  to       supply the idea  she had not herself forgotten to feel that the       marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together        and her neighbours at lucas lodge  therefore  for through their       communication with the collinses  the report  she concluded  had       reached lady catherine   had only set that down as almost       certain and immediate  which she had looked forward to as       possible at some future time         in revolving lady catherine s expressions  however  she could not       help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of       her persisting in this interference  from what she had said of       her resolution to prevent their marriage  it occurred to       elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew        and how he might take a similar representation of the evils       attached to a connection with her  she dared not pronounce  she       knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt  or his       dependence on her judgment  but it was natural to suppose that he       thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do  and it       was certain that  in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with       one  whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own        his aunt would address him on his weakest side  with his notions       of dignity  he would probably feel that the arguments  which to       elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous  contained much good       sense and solid reasoning         if he had been wavering before as to what he should do  which had       often seemed likely  the advice and entreaty of so near a       relation might settle every doubt  and determine him at once to       be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him  in that case       he would return no more  lady catherine might see him in her way       through town  and his engagement to bingley of coming again to       netherfield must give way          if  therefore  an excuse for not keeping his promise should come       to his friend within a few days   she added   i shall know how to       understand it  i shall then give over every expectation  every       wish of his constancy  if he is satisfied with only regretting       me  when he might have obtained my affections and hand  i shall       soon cease to regret him at all          the surprise of the rest of the family  on hearing who their       visitor had been  was very great  but they obligingly satisfied       it  with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs        bennet s curiosity  and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on       the subject         the next morning  as she was going downstairs  she was met by her       father  who came out of his library with a letter in his hand          lizzy   said he   i was going to look for you  come into my       room          she followed him thither  and her curiosity to know what he had       to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in       some manner connected with the letter he held  it suddenly struck       her that it might be from lady catherine  and she anticipated       with dismay all the consequent explanations         she followed her father to the fire place  and they both sat       down  he then said          i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me       exceedingly  as it principally concerns yourself  you ought to       know its contents  i did not know before  that i had two       daughters on the brink of matrimony  let me congratulate you on a       very important conquest          the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the       instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew        instead of the aunt  and she was undetermined whether most to be       pleased that he explained himself at all  or offended that his       letter was not rather addressed to herself  when her father       continued          you look conscious  young ladies have great penetration in such       matters as these  but i think i may defy even your sagacity  to       discover the name of your admirer  this letter is from mr        collins           from mr  collins  and what can he have to say           something very much to the purpose of course  he begins with       congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest       daughter  of which  it seems  he has been told by some of the       good natured  gossiping lucases  i shall not sport with your       impatience  by reading what he says on that point  what relates       to yourself  is as follows   having thus offered you the sincere       congratulations of mrs  collins and myself on this happy event        let me now add a short hint on the subject of another  of which       we have been advertised by the same authority  your daughter       elizabeth  it is presumed  will not long bear the name of bennet        after her elder sister has resigned it  and the chosen partner of       her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most       illustrious personages in this land           can you possibly guess  lizzy  who is meant by this   this young       gentleman is blessed  in a peculiar way  with every thing the       heart of mortal can most desire  splendid property  noble       kindred  and extensive patronage  yet in spite of all these       temptations  let me warn my cousin elizabeth  and yourself  of       what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this       gentleman s proposals  which  of course  you will be inclined to       take immediate advantage of           have you any idea  lizzy  who this gentleman is  but now it       comes out           my motive for cautioning you is as follows  we have reason to       imagine that his aunt  lady catherine de bourgh  does not look on       the match with a friendly eye           mr  darcy  you see  is the man  now  lizzy  i think i have       surprised you  could he  or the lucases  have pitched on any man       within the circle of our acquaintance  whose name would have       given the lie more effectually to what they related  mr  darcy        who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish  and who       probably never looked at you in his life  it is admirable          elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry  but could       only force one most reluctant smile  never had his wit been       directed in a manner so little agreeable to her          are you not diverted           oh  yes  pray read on            after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her       ladyship last night  she immediately  with her usual       condescension  expressed what she felt on the occasion  when it       became apparent  that on the score of some family objections on       the part of my cousin  she would never give her consent to what       she termed so disgraceful a match  i thought it my duty to give       the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin  that she and her       noble admirer may be aware of what they are about  and not run       hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned         mr  collins moreover adds   i am truly rejoiced that my cousin       lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up  and am only       concerned that their living together before the marriage took       place should be so generally known  i must not  however  neglect       the duties of my station  or refrain from declaring my amazement       at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as       soon as they were married  it was an encouragement of vice  and       had i been the rector of longbourn  i should very strenuously       have opposed it  you ought certainly to forgive them  as a       christian  but never to admit them in your sight  or allow their       names to be mentioned in your hearing   that is his notion of       christian forgiveness  the rest of his letter is only about his       dear charlotte s situation  and his expectation of a young       olive branch  but  lizzy  you look as if you did not enjoy it        you are not going to be missish  i hope  and pretend to be       affronted at an idle report  for what do we live  but to make       sport for our neighbours  and laugh at them in our turn           oh   cried elizabeth   i am excessively diverted  but it is so       strange           yes that is what makes it amusing  had they fixed on any other       man it would have been nothing  but his perfect indifference        and your pointed dislike  make it so delightfully absurd  much       as i abominate writing  i would not give up mr  collins s       correspondence for any consideration  nay  when i read a letter       of his  i cannot help giving him the preference even over       wickham  much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my       son in law  and pray  lizzy  what said lady catherine about this       report  did she call to refuse her consent          to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh  and as       it had been asked without the least suspicion  she was not       distressed by his repeating it  elizabeth had never been more at       a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not  it was       necessary to laugh  when she would rather have cried  her father       had most cruelly mortified her  by what he said of mr  darcy s       indifference  and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want       of penetration  or fear that perhaps  instead of his seeing too       little  she might have fancied too much              instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend        as elizabeth half expected mr  bingley to do  he was able to       bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed       after lady catherine s visit  the gentlemen arrived early  and        before mrs  bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his       aunt  of which her daughter sat in momentary dread  bingley  who       wanted to be alone with jane  proposed their all walking out  it       was agreed to  mrs  bennet was not in the habit of walking  mary       could never spare time  but the remaining five set off together        bingley and jane  however  soon allowed the others to outstrip       them  they lagged behind  while elizabeth  kitty  and darcy were       to entertain each other  very little was said by either  kitty       was too much afraid of him to talk  elizabeth was secretly       forming a desperate resolution  and perhaps he might be doing the       same         they walked towards the lucases  because kitty wished to call       upon maria  and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a       general concern  when kitty left them she went boldly on with him       alone  now was the moment for her resolution to be executed  and        while her courage was high  she immediately said          mr  darcy  i am a very selfish creature  and  for the sake of       giving relief to my own feelings  care not how much i may be       wounding yours  i can no longer help thanking you for your       unexampled kindness to my poor sister  ever since i have known       it  i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully       i feel it  were it known to the rest of my family  i should not       have merely my own gratitude to express           i am sorry  exceedingly sorry   replied darcy  in a tone of       surprise and emotion   that you have ever been informed of what       may  in a mistaken light  have given you uneasiness  i did not       think mrs  gardiner was so little to be trusted           you must not blame my aunt  lydia s thoughtlessness first       betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter  and  of       course  i could not rest till i knew the particulars  let me       thank you again and again  in the name of all my family  for that       generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble        and bear so many mortifications  for the sake of discovering       them           if you will thank me   he replied   let it be for yourself       alone  that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force       to the other inducements which led me on  i shall not attempt to       deny  but your family owe me nothing  much as i respect them  i       believe i thought only of you          elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word  after a short       pause  her companion added   you are too generous to trifle with       me  if your feelings are still what they were last april  tell me       so at once  my affections and wishes are unchanged  but one       word from you will silence me on this subject for ever          elizabeth  feeling all the more than common awkwardness and       anxiety of his situation  now forced herself to speak  and       immediately  though not very fluently  gave him to understand       that her sentiments had undergone so material a change  since the       period to which he alluded  as to make her receive with gratitude       and pleasure his present assurances  the happiness which this       reply produced  was such as he had probably never felt before        and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as       warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do  had       elizabeth been able to encounter his eye  she might have seen how       well the expression of heartfelt delight  diffused over his face        became him  but  though she could not look  she could listen  and       he told her of feelings  which  in proving of what importance she       was to him  made his affection every moment more valuable         they walked on  without knowing in what direction  there was too       much to be thought  and felt  and said  for attention to any       other objects  she soon learnt that they were indebted for their       present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt  who did       call on him in her return through london  and there relate her       journey to longbourn  its motive  and the substance of her       conversation with elizabeth  dwelling emphatically on every       expression of the latter which  in her ladyship s apprehension        peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance  in the belief       that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that       promise from her nephew which she had refused to give  but        unluckily for her ladyship  its effect had been exactly       contrariwise          it taught me to hope   said he   as i had scarcely ever allowed       myself to hope before  i knew enough of your disposition to be       certain that  had you been absolutely  irrevocably decided       against me  you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine        frankly and openly          elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied   yes  you know       enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that  after       abusing you so abominably to your face  i could have no scruple       in abusing you to all your relations           what did you say of me  that i did not deserve  for  though your       accusations were ill founded  formed on mistaken premises  my       behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof  it       was unpardonable  i cannot think of it without abhorrence           we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to       that evening   said elizabeth   the conduct of neither  if       strictly examined  will be irreproachable  but since then  we       have both  i hope  improved in civility           i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself  the recollection of       what i then said  of my conduct  my manners  my expressions       during the whole of it  is now  and has been many months        inexpressibly painful to me  your reproof  so well applied  i       shall never forget   had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike       manner   those were your words  you know not  you can scarcely       conceive  how they have tortured me  though it was some time  i       confess  before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice           i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong       an impression  i had not the smallest idea of their being ever       felt in such a way           i can easily believe it  you thought me then devoid of every       proper feeling  i am sure you did  the turn of your countenance i       shall never forget  as you said that i could not have addressed       you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me           oh  do not repeat what i then said  these recollections will not       do at all  i assure you that i have long been most heartily       ashamed of it          darcy mentioned his letter   did it   said he   did it soon make       you think better of me  did you  on reading it  give any credit       to its contents          she explained what its effect on her had been  and how gradually       all her former prejudices had been removed          i knew   said he   that what i wrote must give you pain  but it       was necessary  i hope you have destroyed the letter  there was       one part especially  the opening of it  which i should dread your       having the power of reading again  i can remember some       expressions which might justly make you hate me           the letter shall certainly be burnt  if you believe it essential       to the preservation of my regard  but  though we have both reason       to think my opinions not entirely unalterable  they are not  i       hope  quite so easily changed as that implies           when i wrote that letter   replied darcy   i believed myself       perfectly calm and cool  but i am since convinced that it was       written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit           the letter  perhaps  began in bitterness  but it did not end so        the adieu is charity itself  but think no more of the letter  the       feelings of the person who wrote  and the person who received it        are now so widely different from what they were then  that every       unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten  you       must learn some of my philosophy  think only of the past as its       remembrance gives you pleasure           i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind  your       retrospections must be so totally void of reproach  that the       contentment arising from them is not of philosophy  but  what is       much better  of innocence  but with me  it is not so  painful       recollections will intrude which cannot  which ought not  to be       repelled  i have been a selfish being all my life  in practice        though not in principle  as a child i was taught what was       right  but i was not taught to correct my temper  i was given       good principles  but left to follow them in pride and conceit        unfortunately an only son  for many years an only child   i was       spoilt by my parents  who  though good themselves  my father        particularly  all that was benevolent and amiable   allowed        encouraged  almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing  to       care for none beyond my own family circle  to think meanly of all       the rest of the world  to wish at least to think meanly of       their sense and worth compared with my own  such i was  from       eight to eight and twenty  and such i might still have been but       for you  dearest  loveliest elizabeth  what do i not owe you  you       taught me a lesson  hard indeed at first  but most advantageous        by you  i was properly humbled  i came to you without a doubt of       my reception  you showed me how insufficient were all my       pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased           had you then persuaded yourself that i should           indeed i had  what will you think of my vanity  i believed you       to be wishing  expecting my addresses           my manners must have been in fault  but not intentionally  i       assure you  i never meant to deceive you  but my spirits might       often lead me wrong  how you must have hated me after that       evening           hate you  i was angry perhaps at first  but my anger soon began       to take a proper direction           i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me  when we met       at pemberley  you blamed me for coming           no indeed  i felt nothing but surprise           your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed       by you  my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary       politeness  and i confess that i did not expect to receive more       than my due           my object then   replied darcy   was to show you  by every       civility in my power  that i was not so mean as to resent the       past  and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness  to lessen your ill       opinion  by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended       to  how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly       tell  but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you          he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance  and       of her disappointment at its sudden interruption  which naturally       leading to the cause of that interruption  she soon learnt that       his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her       sister had been formed before he quitted the inn  and that his       gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other       struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend         she expressed her gratitude again  but it was too painful a       subject to each  to be dwelt on farther         after walking several miles in a leisurely manner  and too busy       to know anything about it  they found at last  on examining their       watches  that it was time to be at home          what could become of mr  bingley and jane   was a wonder which       introduced the discussion of their affairs  darcy was delighted       with their engagement  his friend had given him the earliest       information of it          i must ask whether you were surprised   said elizabeth          not at all  when i went away  i felt that it would soon happen           that is to say  you had given your permission  i guessed as       much   and though he exclaimed at the term  she found that it had       been pretty much the case          on the evening before my going to london   said he   i made a       confession to him  which i believe i ought to have made long ago        i told him of all that had occurred to make my former       interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent  his surprise       was great  he had never had the slightest suspicion  i told him        moreover  that i believed myself mistaken in supposing  as i had       done  that your sister was indifferent to him  and as i could       easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated  i felt       no doubt of their happiness together          elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing       his friend          did you speak from your own observation   said she   when you       told him that my sister loved him  or merely from my information       last spring           from the former  i had narrowly observed her during the two       visits which i had lately made here  and i was convinced of her       affection           and your assurance of it  i suppose  carried immediate       conviction to him           it did  bingley is most unaffectedly modest  his diffidence had       prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case        but his reliance on mine made every thing easy  i was obliged to       confess one thing  which for a time  and not unjustly  offended       him  i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had       been in town three months last winter  that i had known it  and       purposely kept it from him  he was angry  but his anger  i am       persuaded  lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your       sister s sentiments  he has heartily forgiven me now          elizabeth longed to observe that mr  bingley had been a most       delightful friend  so easily guided that his worth was       invaluable  but she checked herself  she remembered that he had       yet to learn to be laughed at  and it was rather too early to       begin  in anticipating the happiness of bingley  which of course       was to be inferior only to his own  he continued the conversation       till they reached the house  in the hall they parted               my dear lizzy  where can you have been walking to   was a       question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she       entered their room  and from all the others when they sat down to       table  she had only to say in reply  that they had wandered       about  till she was beyond her own knowledge  she coloured as she       spoke  but neither that  nor anything else  awakened a suspicion       of the truth         the evening passed quietly  unmarked by anything extraordinary        the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed  the unacknowledged       were silent  darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness       overflows in mirth  and elizabeth  agitated and confused  rather       knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so  for        besides the immediate embarrassment  there were other evils       before her  she anticipated what would be felt in the family when       her situation became known  she was aware that no one liked him       but jane  and even feared that with the others it was a dislike       which not all his fortune and consequence might do away         at night she opened her heart to jane  though suspicion was very       far from miss bennet s general habits  she was absolutely       incredulous here          you are joking  lizzy  this cannot be  engaged to mr  darcy  no        no  you shall not deceive me  i know it to be impossible           this is a wretched beginning indeed  my sole dependence was on       you  and i am sure nobody else will believe me  if you do not        yet  indeed  i am in earnest  i speak nothing but the truth  he       still loves me  and we are engaged          jane looked at her doubtingly   oh  lizzy  it cannot be  i know       how much you dislike him           you know nothing of the matter  that is all to be forgot        perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now  but in       such cases as these  a good memory is unpardonable  this is the       last time i shall ever remember it myself          miss bennet still looked all amazement  elizabeth again  and more       seriously assured her of its truth          good heaven  can it be really so  yet now i must believe you         cried jane   my dear  dear lizzy  i would i do congratulate       you but are you certain  forgive the question are you quite       certain that you can be happy with him           there can be no doubt of that  it is settled between us already        that we are to be the happiest couple in the world  but are you       pleased  jane  shall you like to have such a brother           very  very much  nothing could give either bingley or myself       more delight  but we considered it  we talked of it as       impossible  and do you really love him quite well enough  oh        lizzy  do anything rather than marry without affection  are you       quite sure that you feel what you ought to do           oh  yes  you will only think i feel more than i ought to do        when i tell you all           what do you mean           why  i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley  i       am afraid you will be angry           my dearest sister  now be serious  i want to talk very       seriously  let me know every thing that i am to know  without       delay  will you tell me how long you have loved him           it has been coming on so gradually  that i hardly know when it       began  but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his       beautiful grounds at pemberley          another entreaty that she would be serious  however  produced the       desired effect  and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn       assurances of attachment  when convinced on that article  miss       bennet had nothing further to wish          now i am quite happy   said she   for you will be as happy as       myself  i always had a value for him  were it for nothing but his       love of you  i must always have esteemed him  but now  as       bingley s friend and your husband  there can be only bingley and       yourself more dear to me  but lizzy  you have been very sly  very       reserved with me  how little did you tell me of what passed at       pemberley and lambton  i owe all that i know of it to another        not to you          elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy  she had been       unwilling to mention bingley  and the unsettled state of her own       feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend  but       now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s       marriage  all was acknowledged  and half the night spent in       conversation          good gracious   cried mrs  bennet  as she stood at a window the       next morning   if that disagreeable mr  darcy is not coming here       again with our dear bingley  what can he mean by being so       tiresome as to be always coming here  i had no notion but he       would go a shooting  or something or other  and not disturb us       with his company  what shall we do with him  lizzy  you must walk       out with him again  that he may not be in bingley s way          elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal        yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him       such an epithet         as soon as they entered  bingley looked at her so expressively        and shook hands with such warmth  as left no doubt of his good       information  and he soon afterwards said aloud   mrs  bennet        have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way       again to day           i advise mr  darcy  and lizzy  and kitty   said mrs  bennet   to       walk to oakham mount this morning  it is a nice long walk  and       mr  darcy has never seen the view           it may do very well for the others   replied mr  bingley   but i       am sure it will be too much for kitty  won t it  kitty   kitty       owned that she had rather stay at home  darcy professed a great       curiosity to see the view from the mount  and elizabeth silently       consented  as she went up stairs to get ready  mrs  bennet       followed her  saying          i am quite sorry  lizzy  that you should be forced to have that       disagreeable man all to yourself  but i hope you will not mind       it  it is all for jane s sake  you know  and there is no occasion       for talking to him  except just now and then  so  do not put       yourself to inconvenience          during their walk  it was resolved that mr  bennet s consent       should be asked in the course of the evening  elizabeth reserved       to herself the application for her mother s  she could not       determine how her mother would take it  sometimes doubting       whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome       her abhorrence of the man  but whether she were violently set       against the match  or violently delighted with it  it was certain       that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her       sense  and she could no more bear that mr  darcy should hear the       first raptures of her joy  than the first vehemence of her       disapprobation         in the evening  soon after mr  bennet withdrew to the library        she saw mr  darcy rise also and follow him  and her agitation on       seeing it was extreme  she did not fear her father s opposition        but he was going to be made unhappy  and that it should be       through her means that she  his favourite child  should be       distressing him by her choice  should be filling him with fears       and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection  and       she sat in misery till mr  darcy appeared again  when  looking at       him  she was a little relieved by his smile  in a few minutes he       approached the table where she was sitting with kitty  and  while       pretending to admire her work said in a whisper   go to your       father  he wants you in the library   she was gone directly         her father was walking about the room  looking grave and anxious         lizzy   said he   what are you doing  are you out of your       senses  to be accepting this man  have not you always hated him          how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been       more reasonable  her expressions more moderate  it would have       spared her from explanations and professions which it was       exceedingly awkward to give  but they were now necessary  and she       assured him  with some confusion  of her attachment to mr  darcy          or  in other words  you are determined to have him  he is rich        to be sure  and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages       than jane  but will they make you happy           have you any other objection   said elizabeth   than your belief       of my indifference           none at all  we all know him to be a proud  unpleasant sort of       man  but this would be nothing if you really liked him           i do  i do like him   she replied  with tears in her eyes   i       love him  indeed he has no improper pride  he is perfectly       amiable  you do not know what he really is  then pray do not pain       me by speaking of him in such terms           lizzy   said her father   i have given him my consent  he is the       kind of man  indeed  to whom i should never dare refuse anything        which he condescended to ask  i now give it to you  if you are       resolved on having him  but let me advise you to think better of       it  i know your disposition  lizzy  i know that you could be       neither happy nor respectable  unless you truly esteemed your       husband  unless you looked up to him as a superior  your lively       talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal       marriage  you could scarcely escape discredit and misery  my       child  let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to       respect your partner in life  you know not what you are about          elizabeth  still more affected  was earnest and solemn in her       reply  and at length  by repeated assurances that mr  darcy was       really the object of her choice  by explaining the gradual change       which her estimation of him had undergone  relating her absolute       certainty that his affection was not the work of a day  but had       stood the test of many months  suspense  and enumerating with       energy all his good qualities  she did conquer her father s       incredulity  and reconcile him to the match          well  my dear   said he  when she ceased speaking   i have no       more to say  if this be the case  he deserves you  i could not       have parted with you  my lizzy  to anyone less worthy          to complete the favourable impression  she then told him what mr        darcy had voluntarily done for lydia  he heard her with       astonishment          this is an evening of wonders  indeed  and so  darcy did every       thing  made up the match  gave the money  paid the fellow s       debts  and got him his commission  so much the better  it will       save me a world of trouble and economy  had it been your uncle s       doing  i must and would have paid him  but these violent young       lovers carry every thing their own way  i shall offer to pay him       to morrow  he will rant and storm about his love for you  and       there will be an end of the matter          he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before  on his       reading mr  collins s letter  and after laughing at her some       time  allowed her at last to go saying  as she quitted the room         if any young men come for mary or kitty  send them in  for i am       quite at leisure          elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight  and        after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room  she was       able to join the others with tolerable composure  every thing was       too recent for gaiety  but the evening passed tranquilly away        there was no longer anything material to be dreaded  and the       comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time         when her mother went up to her dressing room at night  she       followed her  and made the important communication  its effect       was most extraordinary  for on first hearing it  mrs  bennet sat       quite still  and unable to utter a syllable  nor was it under       many  many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard        though not in general backward to credit what was for the       advantage of her family  or that came in the shape of a lover to       any of them  she began at length to recover  to fidget about in       her chair  get up  sit down again  wonder  and bless herself          good gracious  lord bless me  only think  dear me  mr  darcy        who would have thought it  and is it really true  oh  my sweetest       lizzy  how rich and how great you will be  what pin money  what       jewels  what carriages you will have  jane s is nothing to       it nothing at all  i am so pleased so happy  such a charming       man  so handsome  so tall  oh  my dear lizzy  pray apologise for       my having disliked him so much before  i hope he will overlook       it  dear  dear lizzy  a house in town  every thing that is       charming  three daughters married  ten thousand a year  oh  lord        what will become of me  i shall go distracted          this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be       doubted  and elizabeth  rejoicing that such an effusion was heard       only by herself  soon went away  but before she had been three       minutes in her own room  her mother followed her          my dearest child   she cried   i can think of nothing else  ten       thousand a year  and very likely more   tis as good as a lord        and a special licence  you must and shall be married by a special       licence  but my dearest love  tell me what dish mr  darcy is       particularly fond of  that i may have it to morrow          this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the       gentleman himself might be  and elizabeth found that  though in       the certain possession of his warmest affection  and secure of       her relations  consent  there was still something to be wished       for  but the morrow passed off much better than she expected  for       mrs  bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law       that she ventured not to speak to him  unless it was in her power       to offer him any attention  or mark her deference for his       opinion         elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains       to get acquainted with him  and mr  bennet soon assured her that       he was rising every hour in his esteem          i admire all my three sons in law highly   said he   wickham        perhaps  is my favourite  but i think i shall like your husband       quite as well as jane s               elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again  she wanted       mr  darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her         how could you begin   said she   i can comprehend your going on       charmingly  when you had once made a beginning  but what could       set you off in the first place           i cannot fix on the hour  or the spot  or the look  or the       words  which laid the foundation  it is too long ago  i was in       the middle before i knew that i had begun           my beauty you had early withstood  and as for my manners my       behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil        and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain       than not  now be sincere  did you admire me for my impertinence           for the liveliness of your mind  i did           you may as well call it impertinence at once  it was very little       less  the fact is  that you were sick of civility  of deference        of officious attention  you were disgusted with the women who       were always speaking  and looking  and thinking for your       approbation alone  i roused  and interested you  because i was so       unlike them  had you not been really amiable  you would have       hated me for it  but in spite of the pains you took to disguise       yourself  your feelings were always noble and just  and in your       heart  you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously       courted you  there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for       it  and really  all things considered  i begin to think it       perfectly reasonable  to be sure  you knew no actual good of       me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love           was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while       she was ill at netherfield           dearest jane  who could have done less for her  but make a       virtue of it by all means  my good qualities are under your       protection  and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible        and  in return  it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing       and quarrelling with you as often as may be  and i shall begin       directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the       point at last  what made you so shy of me  when you first called        and afterwards dined here  why  especially  when you called  did       you look as if you did not care about me           because you were grave and silent  and gave me no       encouragement           but i was embarrassed           and so was i           you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner           a man who had felt less  might           how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give        and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it  but i wonder       how long you would have gone on  if you had been left to       yourself  i wonder when you would have spoken  if i had not       asked you  my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to       lydia had certainly great effect  too much  i am afraid  for       what becomes of the moral  if our comfort springs from a breach       of promise  for i ought not to have mentioned the subject  this       will never do           you need not distress yourself  the moral will be perfectly       fair  lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us       were the means of removing all my doubts  i am not indebted for       my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your       gratitude  i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of       yours  my aunt s intelligence had given me hope  and i was       determined at once to know every thing           lady catherine has been of infinite use  which ought to make her       happy  for she loves to be of use  but tell me  what did you come       down to netherfield for  was it merely to ride to longbourn and       be embarrassed  or had you intended any more serious       consequence           my real purpose was to see you  and to judge  if i could        whether i might ever hope to make you love me  my avowed one  or       what i avowed to myself  was to see whether your sister were       still partial to bingley  and if she were  to make the confession       to him which i have since made           shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what       is to befall her           i am more likely to want  time than courage  elizabeth  but it       ought to be done  and if you will give me a sheet of paper  it       shall be done directly           and if i had not a letter to write myself  i might sit by you       and admire the evenness of your writing  as another young lady       once did  but i have an aunt  too  who must not be longer       neglected          from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr        darcy had been over rated  elizabeth had never yet answered mrs        gardiner s long letter  but now  having that to communicate       which she knew would be most welcome  she was almost ashamed to       find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of       happiness  and immediately wrote as follows          i would have thanked you before  my dear aunt  as i ought to       have done  for your long  kind  satisfactory  detail of       particulars  but to say the truth  i was too cross to write  you       supposed more than really existed  but now suppose as much as       you choose  give a loose rein to your fancy  indulge your       imagination in every possible flight which the subject will       afford  and unless you believe me actually married  you cannot       greatly err  you must write again very soon  and praise him a       great deal more than you did in your last  i thank you  again and       again  for not going to the lakes  how could i be so silly as to       wish it  your idea of the ponies is delightful  we will go round       the park every day  i am the happiest creature in the world        perhaps other people have said so before  but not one with such       justice  i am happier even than jane  she only smiles  i laugh        mr  darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare       from me  you are all to come to pemberley at christmas  yours        etc          mr  darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style        and still different from either was what mr  bennet sent to mr        collins  in reply to his last          dear sir         i must trouble you once more for congratulations  elizabeth will       soon be the wife of mr  darcy  console lady catherine as well as       you can  but  if i were you  i would stand by the nephew  he has       more to give          yours sincerely  etc          miss bingley s congratulations to her brother  on his approaching       marriage  were all that was affectionate and insincere  she wrote       even to jane on the occasion  to express her delight  and repeat       all her former professions of regard  jane was not deceived  but       she was affected  and though feeling no reliance on her  could       not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was       deserved         the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar       information  was as sincere as her brother s in sending it  four       sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight  and       all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister         before any answer could arrive from mr  collins  or any       congratulations to elizabeth from his wife  the longbourn family       heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge  the       reason of this sudden removal was soon evident  lady catherine       had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her       nephew s letter  that charlotte  really rejoicing in the match        was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over  at such a       moment  the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to       elizabeth  though in the course of their meetings she must       sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought  when she saw mr        darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her       husband  he bore it  however  with admirable calmness  he could       even listen to sir william lucas  when he complimented him on       carrying away the brightest jewel of the country  and expressed       his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st  james s  with       very decent composure  if he did shrug his shoulders  it was not       till sir william was out of sight         mrs  phillips s vulgarity was another  and perhaps a greater  tax       on his forbearance  and though mrs  phillips  as well as her       sister  stood in too much awe of him to speak with the       familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged  yet  whenever       she did speak  she must be vulgar  nor was her respect for him        though it made her more quiet  at all likely to make her more       elegant  elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the       frequent notice of either  and was ever anxious to keep him to       herself  and to those of her family with whom he might converse       without mortification  and though the uncomfortable feelings       arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of       its pleasure  it added to the hope of the future  and she looked       forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from       society so little pleasing to either  to all the comfort and       elegance of their family party at pemberley              happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs        bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters  with what       delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs  bingley  and talked       of mrs  darcy  may be guessed  i wish i could say  for the sake       of her family  that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in       the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an       effect as to make her a sensible  amiable  well informed woman       for the rest of her life  though perhaps it was lucky for her       husband  who might not have relished domestic felicity in so       unusual a form  that she still was occasionally nervous and       invariably silly         mr  bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly  his affection       for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do        he delighted in going to pemberley  especially when he was least       expected         mr  bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth        so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not       desirable even to his easy temper  or her affectionate heart        the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified  he bought an       estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire  and jane and       elizabeth  in addition to every other source of happiness  were       within thirty miles of each other         kitty  to her very material advantage  spent the chief of her       time with her two elder sisters  in society so superior to what       she had generally known  her improvement was great  she was not       of so ungovernable a temper as lydia  and  removed from the       influence of lydia s example  she became  by proper attention and       management  less irritable  less ignorant  and less insipid  from       the further disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course       carefully kept  and though mrs  wickham frequently invited her to       come and stay with her  with the promise of balls and young men        her father would never consent to her going         mary was the only daughter who remained at home  and she was       necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs        bennet s being quite unable to sit alone  mary was obliged to mix       more with the world  but she could still moralize over every       morning visit  and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons       between her sisters  beauty and her own  it was suspected by her       father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance         as for wickham and lydia  their characters suffered no revolution       from the marriage of her sisters  he bore with philosophy the       conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with       whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown       to her  and in spite of every thing  was not wholly without hope       that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune  the       congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her       marriage  explained to her that  by his wife at least  if not by       himself  such a hope was cherished  the letter was to this       effect          my dear lizzy         i wish you joy  if you love mr  darcy half as well as i do my       dear wickham  you must be very happy  it is a great comfort to       have you so rich  and when you have nothing else to do  i hope       you will think of us  i am sure wickham would like a place at       court very much  and i do not think we shall have quite money       enough to live upon without some help  any place would do  of       about three or four hundred a year  but however  do not speak to       mr  darcy about it  if you had rather not          yours  etc          as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not  she       endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and       expectation of the kind  such relief  however  as it was in her       power to afford  by the practice of what might be called economy       in her own private expences  she frequently sent them  it had       always been evident to her that such an income as theirs  under       the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants  and       heedless of the future  must be very insufficient to their       support  and whenever they changed their quarters  either jane or       herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance       towards discharging their bills  their manner of living  even       when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home  was       unsettled in the extreme  they were always moving from place to       place in quest of a cheap situation  and always spending more       than they ought  his affection for her soon sunk into       indifference  hers lasted a little longer  and in spite of her       youth and her manners  she retained all the claims to reputation       which her marriage had given her         though darcy could never receive him at pemberley  yet  for       elizabeth s sake  he assisted him further in his profession        lydia was occasionally a visitor there  when her husband was gone       to enjoy himself in london or bath  and with the bingleys they       both of them frequently staid so long  that even bingley s good       humour was overcome  and he proceeded so far as to talk of       giving them a hint to be gone         miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage  but       as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at       pemberley  she dropt all her resentment  was fonder than ever of       georgiana  almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore  and paid       off every arrear of civility to elizabeth         pemberley was now georgiana s home  and the attachment of the       sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see  they were able       to love each other even as well as they intended  georgiana had       the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth  though at first       she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her       lively  sportive  manner of talking to her brother  he  who had       always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her       affection  she now saw the object of open pleasantry  her mind       received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way  by       elizabeth s instructions  she began to comprehend that a woman       may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not       always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than       himself         lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her       nephew  and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her       character in her reply to the letter which announced its       arrangement  she sent him language so very abusive  especially of       elizabeth  that for some time all intercourse was at an end  but       at length  by elizabeth s persuasion  he was prevailed on to       overlook the offence  and seek a reconciliation  and  after a       little further resistance on the part of his aunt  her resentment       gave way  either to her affection for him  or her curiosity to       see how his wife conducted herself  and she condescended to wait       on them at pemberley  in spite of that pollution which its woods       had received  not merely from the presence of such a mistress        but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city         with the gardiners  they were always on the most intimate terms        darcy  as well as elizabeth  really loved them  and they were       both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons       who  by bringing her into derbyshire  had been the means of       uniting them          end of the project

best of times  it was the worst of times  it was the age of wisdom  it was the age of foolishness  it was the epoch of belief  it was the epoch of incredulity  it was the season of light  it was the season of darkness  it was the spring of hope  it was the winter of despair  we had everything before us  we had nothing before us  we were all going direct to heaven  we were all going direct the other way   in short  the period was so far like the present period  that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received  for good or for evil  in the superlative degree of comparison only   there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face  on the throne of england  there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face  on the throne of france  in both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the state preserves of loaves and fishes  that things in general were settled for ever   it was the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy five  spiritual revelations were conceded to england at that favoured period  as at this  mrs  southcott had recently attained her five and twentieth blessed birthday  of whom a prophetic private in the life guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of london and westminster  even the cock lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years  after rapping out its messages  as the spirits of this very year last past  supernaturally deficient in originality  rapped out theirs  mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the english crown and people  from a congress of british subjects in america  which  strange to relate  have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the cock lane brood   france  less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident  rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill  making paper money and spending it  under the guidance of her christian pastors  she entertained herself  besides  with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off  his tongue torn out with pincers  and his body burned alive  because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view  at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards  it is likely enough that  rooted in the woods of france and norway  there were growing trees  when that sufferer was put to death  already marked by the woodman  fate  to come down and be sawn into boards  to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it  terrible in history  it is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to paris  there were sheltered from the weather that very day  rude carts  bespattered with rustic mire  snuffed about by pigs  and roosted in by poultry  which the farmer  death  had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the revolution  but that woodman and that farmer  though they work unceasingly  work silently  and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread  the rather  forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake  was to be atheistical and traitorous   in england  there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting  daring burglaries by armed men  and highway robberies  took place in the capital itself every night  families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers  warehouses for security  the highwayman in the dark was a city tradesman in the light  and  being recognised and challenged by his fellow tradesman whom he stopped in his character of  the captain   gallantly shot him through the head and rode away  the mail was waylaid by seven robbers  and the guard shot three dead  and then got shot dead himself by the other four   in consequence of the failure of his ammunition   after which the mail was robbed in peace  that magnificent potentate  the lord mayor of london  was made to stand and deliver on turnham green  by one highwayman  who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue  prisoners in london gaols fought battles with their turnkeys  and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them  loaded with rounds of shot and ball  thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at court drawing rooms  musketeers went into st  giles s  to search for contraband goods  and the mob fired on the musketeers  and the musketeers fired on the mob  and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way  in the midst of them  the hangman  ever busy and ever worse than useless  was in constant requisition  now  stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals  now  hanging a housebreaker on saturday who had been taken on tuesday  now  burning people in the hand at newgate by the dozen  and now burning pamphlets at the door of westminster hall  to day  taking the life of an atrocious murderer  and to morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer s boy of sixpence   all these things  and a thousand like them  came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy five  environed by them  while the woodman and the farmer worked unheeded  those two of the large jaws  and those other two of the plain and the fair faces  trod with stir enough  and carried their divine rights with a high hand  thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy five conduct their greatnesses  and myriads of small creatures  the creatures of this chronicle among the rest  along the roads that lay before them      ii  the mail   it was the dover road that lay  on a friday night late in november  before the first of the persons with whom this history has business  the dover road lay  as to him  beyond the dover mail  as it lumbered up shooter s hill  he walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail  as the rest of the passengers did  not because they had the least relish for walking exercise  under the circumstances  but because the hill  and the harness  and the mud  and the mail  were all so heavy  that the horses had three times already come to a stop  besides once drawing the coach across the road  with the mutinous intent of taking it back to blackheath  reins and whip and coachman and guard  however  in combination  had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument  that some brute animals are endued with reason  and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty   with drooping heads and tremulous tails  they mashed their way through the thick mud  floundering and stumbling between whiles  as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints  as often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand  with a wary  wo ho  so ho then   the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it  like an unusually emphatic horse  denying that the coach could be got up the hill  whenever the leader made this rattle  the passenger started  as a nervous passenger might  and was disturbed in mind   there was a steaming mist in all the hollows  and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill  like an evil spirit  seeking rest and finding none  a clammy and intensely cold mist  it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another  as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do  it was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach lamps but these its own workings  and a few yards of road  and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it  as if they had made it all   two other passengers  besides the one  were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail  all three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears  and wore jack boots  not one of the three could have said  from anything he saw  what either of the other two was like  and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind  as from the eyes of the body  of his two companions  in those days  travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice  for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers  as to the latter  when every posting house and ale house could produce somebody in  the captain s  pay  ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non descript  it was the likeliest thing upon the cards  so the guard of the dover mail thought to himself  that friday night in november  one thousand seven hundred and seventy five  lumbering up shooter s hill  as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail  beating his feet  and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm chest before him  where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse pistols  deposited on a substratum of cutlass   the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers  the passengers suspected one another and the guard  they all suspected everybody else  and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses  as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two testaments that they were not fit for the journey    wo ho   said the coachman   so  then  one more pull and you re at the top and be damned to you  for i have had trouble enough to get you to it   joe     halloa   the guard replied    what o clock do you make it  joe     ten minutes  good  past eleven     my blood   ejaculated the vexed coachman   and not atop of shooter s yet  tst  yah  get on with you    the emphatic horse  cut short by the whip in a most decided negative  made a decided scramble for it  and the three other horses followed suit  once more  the dover mail struggled on  with the jack boots of its passengers squashing along by its side  they had stopped when the coach stopped  and they kept close company with it  if any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness  he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman   the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill  the horses stopped to breathe again  and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent  and open the coach door to let the passengers in    tst  joe   cried the coachman in a warning voice  looking down from his box    what do you say  tom    they both listened    i say a horse at a canter coming up  joe     i say a horse at a gallop  tom   returned the guard  leaving his hold of the door  and mounting nimbly to his place   gentlemen  in the king s name  all of you    with this hurried adjuration  he cocked his blunderbuss  and stood on the offensive   the passenger booked by this history  was on the coach step  getting in  the two other passengers were close behind him  and about to follow  he remained on the step  half in the coach and half out of  they remained in the road below him  they all looked from the coachman to the guard  and from the guard to the coachman  and listened  the coachman looked back and the guard looked back  and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back  without contradicting   the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach  added to the stillness of the night  made it very quiet indeed  the panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach  as if it were in a state of agitation  the hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard  but at any rate  the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath  and holding the breath  and having the pulses quickened by expectation   the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill    so ho   the guard sang out  as loud as he could roar   yo there  stand  i shall fire    the pace was suddenly checked  and  with much splashing and floundering  a man s voice called from the mist   is that the dover mail     never you mind what it is   the guard retorted   what are you     is that the dover mail     why do you want to know     i want a passenger  if it is     what passenger     mr  jarvis lorry    our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name  the guard  the coachman  and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully    keep where you are   the guard called to the voice in the mist   because  if i should make a mistake  it could never be set right in your lifetime  gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight     what is the matter   asked the passenger  then  with mildly quavering speech   who wants me  is it jerry      i don t like jerry s voice  if it is jerry   growled the guard to himself   he s hoarser than suits me  is jerry      yes  mr  lorry     what is the matter     a despatch sent after you from over yonder  t  and co     i know this messenger  guard   said mr  lorry  getting down into the road  assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers  who immediately scrambled into the coach  shut the door  and pulled up the window   he may come close  there s nothing wrong     i hope there ain t  but i can t make so  nation sure of that   said the guard  in gruff soliloquy   hallo you     well  and hallo you   said jerry  more hoarsely than before    come on at a footpace  d ye mind me  and if you ve got holsters to that saddle o  yourn  don t let me see your hand go nigh  em  for i m a devil at a quick mistake  and when i make one it takes the form of lead  so now let s look at you    the figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist  and came to the side of the mail  where the passenger stood  the rider stooped  and  casting up his eyes at the guard  handed the passenger a small folded paper  the rider s horse was blown  and both horse and rider were covered with mud  from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man    guard   said the passenger  in a tone of quiet business confidence   the watchful guard  with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss  his left at the barrel  and his eye on the horseman  answered curtly   sir     there is nothing to apprehend  i belong to tellson s bank  you must know tellson s bank in london  i am going to paris on business  a crown to drink  i may read this     if so be as you re quick  sir    he opened it in the light of the coach lamp on that side  and read  first to himself and then aloud    wait at dover for mam selle   it s not long  you see  guard  jerry  say that my answer was  recalled to life    jerry started in his saddle   that s a blazing strange answer  too    said he  at his hoarsest    take that message back  and they will know that i received this  as well as if i wrote  make the best of your way  good night    with those words the passenger opened the coach door and got in  not at all assisted by his fellow passengers  who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots  and were now making a general pretence of being asleep  with no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action   the coach lumbered on again  with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent  the guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm chest  and  having looked to the rest of its contents  and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt  looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat  in which there were a few smith s tools  a couple of torches  and a tinder box  for he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach lamps had been blown and stormed out  which did occasionally happen  he had only to shut himself up inside  keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw  and get a light with tolerable safety and ease  if he were lucky  in five minutes    tom   softly over the coach roof    hallo  joe     did you hear the message     i did  joe     what did you make of it  tom     nothing at all  joe     that s a coincidence  too   the guard mused   for i made the same of it myself    jerry  left alone in the mist and darkness  dismounted meanwhile  not only to ease his spent horse  but to wipe the mud from his face  and shake the wet out of his hat brim  which might be capable of holding about half a gallon  after standing with the bridle over his heavily splashed arm  until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again  he turned to walk down the hill    after that there gallop from temple bar  old lady  i won t trust your fore legs till i get you on the level   said this hoarse messenger  glancing at his mare    recalled to life   that s a blazing strange message  much of that wouldn t do for you  jerry  i say  jerry  you d be in a blazing bad way  if recalling to life was to come into fashion  jerry       iii  the night shadows   a wonderful fact to reflect upon  that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other  a solemn consideration  when i enter a great city by night  that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret  that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret  that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there  is  in some of its imaginings  a secret to the heart nearest it  something of the awfulness  even of death itself  is referable to this  no more can i turn the leaves of this dear book that i loved  and vainly hope in time to read it all  no more can i look into the depths of this unfathomable water  wherein  as momentary lights glanced into it  i have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged  it was appointed that the book should shut with a spring  for ever and for ever  when i had read but a page  it was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost  when the light was playing on its surface  and i stood in ignorance on the shore  my friend is dead  my neighbour is dead  my love  the darling of my soul  is dead  it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality  and which i shall carry in mine to my life s end  in any of the burial places of this city through which i pass  is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are  in their innermost personality  to me  or than i am to them   as to this  his natural and not to be alienated inheritance  the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the king  the first minister of state  or the richest merchant in london  so with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach  they were mysteries to one another  as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six  or his own coach and sixty  with the breadth of a county between him and the next   the messenger rode back at an easy trot  stopping pretty often at ale houses by the way to drink  but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel  and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes  he had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration  being of a surface black  with no depth in the colour or form  and much too near together  as if they were afraid of being found out in something  singly  if they kept too far apart  they had a sinister expression  under an old cocked hat like a three cornered spittoon  and over a great muffler for the chin and throat  which descended nearly to the wearer s knees  when he stopped for drink  he moved this muffler with his left hand  only while he poured his liquor in with his right  as soon as that was done  he muffled again    no  jerry  no   said the messenger  harping on one theme as he rode   it wouldn t do for you  jerry  jerry  you honest tradesman  it wouldn t suit your line of business  recalled    bust me if i don t think he d been a drinking    his message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain  several times  to take off his hat to scratch his head  except on the crown  which was raggedly bald  he had stiff  black hair  standing jaggedly all over it  and growing down hill almost to his broad  blunt nose  it was so like smith s work  so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair  that the best of players at leap frog might have declined him  as the most dangerous man in the world to go over   while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of tellson s bank  by temple bar  who was to deliver it to greater authorities within  the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message  and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness  they seemed to be numerous  for she shied at every shadow on the road   what time  the mail coach lumbered  jolted  rattled  and bumped upon its tedious way  with its three fellow inscrutables inside  to whom  likewise  the shadows of the night revealed themselves  in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested   tellson s bank had a run upon it in the mail  as the bank passenger  with an arm drawn through the leathern strap  which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger  and driving him into his corner  whenever the coach got a special jolt  nodded in his place  with half shut eyes  the little coach windows  and the coach lamp dimly gleaming through them  and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger  became the bank  and did a great stroke of business  the rattle of the harness was the chink of money  and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even tellson s  with all its foreign and home connection  ever paid in thrice the time  then the strong rooms underground  at tellson s  with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger  and it was not a little that he knew about them   opened before him  and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly burning candle  and found them safe  and strong  and sound  and still  just as he had last seen them   but  though the bank was almost always with him  and though the coach  in a confused way  like the presence of pain under an opiate  was always with him  there was another current of impression that never ceased to run  all through the night  he was on his way to dig some one out of a grave   now  which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person  the shadows of the night did not indicate  but they were all the faces of a man of five and forty by years  and they differed principally in the passions they expressed  and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state  pride  contempt  defiance  stubbornness  submission  lamentation  succeeded one another  so did varieties of sunken cheek  cadaverous colour  emaciated hands and figures  but the face was in the main one face  and every head was prematurely white  a hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre    buried how long    the answer was always the same   almost eighteen years     you had abandoned all hope of being dug out     long ago     you know that you are recalled to life     they tell me so     i hope you care to live     i can t say     shall i show her to you  will you come and see her    the answers to this question were various and contradictory  sometimes the broken reply was   wait  it would kill me if i saw her too soon    sometimes  it was given in a tender rain of tears  and then it was   take me to her   sometimes it was staring and bewildered  and then it was   i don t know her  i don t understand    after such imaginary discourse  the passenger in his fancy would dig  and dig  dig  now with a spade  now with a great key  now with his hands  to dig this wretched creature out  got out at last  with earth hanging about his face and hair  he would suddenly fan away to dust  the passenger would then start to himself  and lower the window  to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek   yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain  on the moving patch of light from the lamps  and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks  the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within  the real banking house by temple bar  the real business of the past day  the real strong rooms  the real express sent after him  and the real message returned  would all be there  out of the midst of them  the ghostly face would rise  and he would accost it again    buried how long     almost eighteen years     i hope you care to live     i can t say    dig  dig  dig  until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window  draw his arm securely through the leathern strap  and speculate upon the two slumbering forms  until his mind lost its hold of them  and they again slid away into the bank and the grave    buried how long     almost eighteen years     you had abandoned all hope of being dug out     long ago    the words were still in his hearing as just spoken  distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life  when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight  and found that the shadows of the night were gone   he lowered the window  and looked out at the rising sun  there was a ridge of ploughed land  with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked  beyond  a quiet coppice wood  in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees  though the earth was cold and wet  the sky was clear  and the sun rose bright  placid  and beautiful    eighteen years   said the passenger  looking at the sun   gracious creator of day  to be buried alive for eighteen years       iv  the preparation   when the mail got successfully to dover  in the course of the forenoon  the head drawer at the royal george hotel opened the coach door as his custom was  he did it with some flourish of ceremony  for a mail journey from london in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon   by that time  there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated  for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations  the mildewy inside of the coach  with its damp and dirty straw  its disagreeable smell  and its obscurity  was rather like a larger dog kennel  mr  lorry  the passenger  shaking himself out of it in chains of straw  a tangle of shaggy wrapper  flapping hat  and muddy legs  was rather like a larger sort of dog    there will be a packet to calais  tomorrow  drawer     yes  sir  if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair  the tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon  sir  bed  sir     i shall not go to bed till night  but i want a bedroom  and a barber     and then breakfast  sir  yes  sir  that way  sir  if you please  show concord  gentleman s valise and hot water to concord  pull off gentleman s boots in concord   you will find a fine sea coal fire  sir   fetch barber to concord  stir about there  now  for concord    the concord bed chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail  and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot  the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the royal george  that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it  all kinds and varieties of men came out of it  consequently  another drawer  and two porters  and several maids and the landlady  were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the concord and the coffee room  when a gentleman of sixty  formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes  pretty well worn  but very well kept  with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets  passed along on his way to his breakfast   the coffee room had no other occupant  that forenoon  than the gentleman in brown  his breakfast table was drawn before the fire  and as he sat  with its light shining on him  waiting for the meal  he sat so still  that he might have been sitting for his portrait   very orderly and methodical he looked  with a hand on each knee  and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist coat  as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire  he had a good leg  and was a little vain of it  for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close  and were of a fine texture  his shoes and buckles  too  though plain  were trim  he wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig  setting very close to his head  which wig  it is to be presumed  was made of hair  but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass  his linen  though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings  was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach  or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea  a face habitually suppressed and quieted  was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner  in years gone by  some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of tellson s bank  he had a healthy colour in his cheeks  and his face  though lined  bore few traces of anxiety  but  perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in tellson s bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people  and perhaps second hand cares  like second hand clothes  come easily off and on   completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait  mr  lorry dropped off to sleep  the arrival of his breakfast roused him  and he said to the drawer  as he moved his chair to it    i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to day  she may ask for mr  jarvis lorry  or she may only ask for a gentleman from tellson s bank  please to let me know     yes  sir  tellson s bank in london  sir     yes     yes  sir  we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and paris  sir  a vast deal of travelling  sir  in tellson and company s house     yes  we are quite a french house  as well as an english one     yes  sir  not much in the habit of such travelling yourself  i think  sir     not of late years  it is fifteen years since we  since i  came last from france     indeed  sir  that was before my time here  sir  before our people s time here  sir  the george was in other hands at that time  sir     i believe so     but i would hold a pretty wager  sir  that a house like tellson and company was flourishing  a matter of fifty  not to speak of fifteen years ago     you might treble that  and say a hundred and fifty  yet not be far from the truth     indeed  sir    rounding his mouth and both his eyes  as he stepped backward from the table  the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left  dropped into a comfortable attitude  and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank  as from an observatory or watchtower  according to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages   when mr  lorry had finished his breakfast  he went out for a stroll on the beach  the little narrow  crooked town of dover hid itself away from the beach  and ran its head into the chalk cliffs  like a marine ostrich  the beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about  and the sea did what it liked  and what it liked was destruction  it thundered at the town  and thundered at the cliffs  and brought the coast down  madly  the air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it  as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea  a little fishing was done in the port  and a quantity of strolling about by night  and looking seaward  particularly at those times when the tide made  and was near flood  small tradesmen  who did no business whatever  sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes  and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter   as the day declined into the afternoon  and the air  which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the french coast to be seen  became again charged with mist and vapour  mr  lorry s thoughts seemed to cloud too  when it was dark  and he sat before the coffee room fire  awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast  his mind was busily digging  digging  digging  in the live red coals   a bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm  otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work  mr  lorry had been idle a long time  and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle  when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street  and rumbled into the inn yard   he set down his glass untouched   this is mam selle   said he   in a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that miss manette had arrived from london  and would be happy to see the gentleman from tellson s    so soon    miss manette had taken some refreshment on the road  and required none then  and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from tellson s immediately  if it suited his pleasure and convenience   the gentleman from tellson s had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation  settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears  and follow the waiter to miss manette s apartment  it was a large  dark room  furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair  and loaded with heavy dark tables  these had been oiled and oiled  until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf  as if they were buried  in deep graves of black mahogany  and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out   the obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that mr  lorry  picking his way over the well worn turkey carpet  supposed miss manette to be  for the moment  in some adjacent room  until  having got past the two tall candles  he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire  a young lady of not more than seventeen  in a riding cloak  and still holding her straw travelling hat by its ribbon in her hand  as his eyes rested on a short  slight  pretty figure  a quantity of golden hair  a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look  and a forehead with a singular capacity  remembering how young and smooth it was   of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity  or wonder  or alarm  or merely of a bright fixed attention  though it included all the four expressions  as his eyes rested on these things  a sudden vivid likeness passed before him  of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very channel  one cold time  when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high  the likeness passed away  like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier glass behind her  on the frame of which  a hospital procession of negro cupids  several headless and all cripples  were offering black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender  and he made his formal bow to miss manette    pray take a seat  sir   in a very clear and pleasant young voice  a little foreign in its accent  but a very little indeed    i kiss your hand  miss   said mr  lorry  with the manners of an earlier date  as he made his formal bow again  and took his seat    i received a letter from the bank  sir  yesterday  informing me that some intelligence  or discovery      the word is not material  miss  either word will do       respecting the small property of my poor father  whom i never saw  so long dead     mr  lorry moved in his chair  and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids  as if they had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets      rendered it necessary that i should go to paris  there to communicate with a gentleman of the bank  so good as to be despatched to paris for the purpose     myself     as i was prepared to hear  sir    she curtseyed to him  young ladies made curtseys in those days   with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she  he made her another bow    i replied to the bank  sir  that as it was considered necessary  by those who know  and who are so kind as to advise me  that i should go to france  and that as i am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me  i should esteem it highly if i might be permitted to place myself  during the journey  under that worthy gentleman s protection  the gentleman had left london  but i think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here     i was happy   said mr  lorry   to be entrusted with the charge  i shall be more happy to execute it     sir  i thank you indeed  i thank you very gratefully  it was told me by the bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business  and that i must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature  i have done my best to prepare myself  and i naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are     naturally   said mr  lorry   yes  i     after a pause  he added  again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears   it is very difficult to begin    he did not begin  but  in his indecision  met her glance  the young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression  but it was pretty and characteristic  besides being singular  and she raised her hand  as if with an involuntary action she caught at  or stayed some passing shadow    are you quite a stranger to me  sir     am i not   mr  lorry opened his hands  and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile   between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose  the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be  the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing  he watched her as she mused  and the moment she raised her eyes again  went on    in your adopted country  i presume  i cannot do better than address you as a young english lady  miss manette     if you please  sir     miss manette  i am a man of business  i have a business charge to acquit myself of  in your reception of it  don t heed me any more than if i was a speaking machine  truly  i am not much else  i will  with your leave  relate to you  miss  the story of one of our customers     story    he seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated  when he added  in a hurry   yes  customers  in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers  he was a french gentleman  a scientific gentleman  a man of great acquirements  a doctor     not of beauvais     why  yes  of beauvais  like monsieur manette  your father  the gentleman was of beauvais  like monsieur manette  your father  the gentleman was of repute in paris  i had the honour of knowing him there  our relations were business relations  but confidential  i was at that time in our french house  and had been  oh  twenty years     at that time  i may ask  at what time  sir     i speak  miss  of twenty years ago  he married  an english lady  and i was one of the trustees  his affairs  like the affairs of many other french gentlemen and french families  were entirely in tellson s hands  in a similar way i am  or i have been  trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers  these are mere business relations  miss  there is no friendship in them  no particular interest  nothing like sentiment  i have passed from one to another  in the course of my business life  just as i pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day  in short  i have no feelings  i am a mere machine  to go on      but this is my father s story  sir  and i begin to think   the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him   that when i was left an orphan through my mother s surviving my father only two years  it was you who brought me to england  i am almost sure it was you    mr  lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his  and he put it with some ceremony to his lips  he then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again  and  holding the chair back with his left hand  and using his right by turns to rub his chin  pull his wig at the ears  or point what he said  stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his    miss manette  it was i  and you will see how truly i spoke of myself just now  in saying i had no feelings  and that all the relations i hold with my fellow creatures are mere business relations  when you reflect that i have never seen you since  no  you have been the ward of tellson s house since  and i have been busy with the other business of tellson s house since  feelings  i have no time for them  no chance of them  i pass my whole life  miss  in turning an immense pecuniary mangle    after this odd description of his daily routine of employment  mr  lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands  which was most unnecessary  for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before   and resumed his former attitude    so far  miss  as you have remarked   this is the story of your regretted father  now comes the difference  if your father had not died when he did  don t be frightened  how you start    she did  indeed  start  and she caught his wrist with both her hands    pray   said mr  lorry  in a soothing tone  bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble   pray control your agitation  a matter of business  as i was saying     her look so discomposed him that he stopped  wandered  and began anew    as i was saying  if monsieur manette had not died  if he had suddenly and silently disappeared  if he had been spirited away  if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place  though no art could trace him  if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that i in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper  across the water there  for instance  the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time  if his wife had implored the king  the queen  the court  the clergy  for any tidings of him  and all quite in vain   then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman  the doctor of beauvais     i entreat you to tell me more  sir     i will  i am going to  you can bear it     i can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment     you speak collectedly  and you  are collected  that s good    though his manner was less satisfied than his words    a matter of business  regard it as a matter of business  business that must be done  now if this doctor s wife  though a lady of great courage and spirit  had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born      the little child was a daughter  sir     a daughter  a a matter of business  don t be distressed  miss  if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born  that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of  by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead  no  don t kneel  in heaven s name why should you kneel to me     for the truth  o dear  good  compassionate sir  for the truth     a  a matter of business  you confuse me  and how can i transact business if i am confused  let us be clear headed  if you could kindly mention now  for instance  what nine times ninepence are  or how many shillings in twenty guineas  it would be so encouraging  i should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind    without directly answering to this appeal  she sat so still when he had very gently raised her  and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been  that she communicated some reassurance to mr  jarvis lorry    that s right  that s right  courage  business  you have business before you  useful business  miss manette  your mother took this course with you  and when she died  i believe broken hearted  having never slackened her unavailing search for your father  she left you  at two years old  to grow to be blooming  beautiful  and happy  without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison  or wasted there through many lingering years    as he said the words he looked down  with an admiring pity  on the flowing golden hair  as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey    you know that your parents had no great possession  and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you  there has been no new discovery  of money  or of any other property  but     he felt his wrist held closer  and he stopped  the expression in the forehead  which had so particularly attracted his notice  and which was now immovable  had deepened into one of pain and horror    but he has been  been found  he is alive  greatly changed  it is too probable  almost a wreck  it is possible  though we will hope the best  still  alive  your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in paris  and we are going there  i  to identify him if i can  you  to restore him to life  love  duty  rest  comfort    a shiver ran through her frame  and from it through his  she said  in a low  distinct  awe stricken voice  as if she were saying it in a dream    i am going to see his ghost  it will be his ghost  not him    mr  lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm   there  there  there  see now  see now  the best and the worst are known to you  now  you are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman  and  with a fair sea voyage  and a fair land journey  you will be soon at his dear side    she repeated in the same tone  sunk to a whisper   i have been free  i have been happy  yet his ghost has never haunted me     only one thing more   said mr  lorry  laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention   he has been found under another name  his own  long forgotten or long concealed  it would be worse than useless now to inquire which  worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked  or always designedly held prisoner  it would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries  because it would be dangerous  better not to mention the subject  anywhere or in any way  and to remove him  for a while at all events  out of france  even i  safe as an englishman  and even tellson s  important as they are to french credit  avoid all naming of the matter  i carry about me  not a scrap of writing openly referring to it  this is a secret service altogether  my credentials  entries  and memoranda  are all comprehended in the one line   recalled to life   which may mean anything  but what is the matter  she doesn t notice a word  miss manette    perfectly still and silent  and not even fallen back in her chair  she sat under his hand  utterly insensible  with her eyes open and fixed upon him  and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead  so close was her hold upon his arm  that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her  therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving   a wild looking woman  whom even in his agitation  mr  lorry observed to be all of a red colour  and to have red hair  and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight fitting fashion  and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure  and good measure too  or a great stilton cheese  came running into the room in advance of the inn servants  and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady  by laying a brawny hand upon his chest  and sending him flying back against the nearest wall     i really think this must be a man   was mr  lorry s breathless reflection  simultaneously with his coming against the wall     why  look at you all   bawled this figure  addressing the inn servants   why don t you go and fetch things  instead of standing there staring at me  i am not so much to look at  am i  why don t you go and fetch things  i ll let you know  if you don t bring smelling salts  cold water  and vinegar  quick  i will    there was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives  and she softly laid the patient on a sofa  and tended her with great skill and gentleness  calling her  my precious   and  my bird   and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care    and you in brown   she said  indignantly turning to mr  lorry   couldn t you tell her what you had to tell her  without frightening her to death  look at her  with her pretty pale face and her cold hands  do you call that being a banker    mr  lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer  that he could only look on  at a distance  with much feebler sympathy and humility  while the strong woman  having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of  letting them know  something not mentioned if they stayed there  staring  recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations  and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder    i hope she will do well now   said mr  lorry    no thanks to you in brown  if she does  my darling pretty     i hope   said mr  lorry  after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility   that you accompany miss manette to france     a likely thing  too   replied the strong woman   if it was ever intended that i should go across salt water  do you suppose providence would have cast my lot in an island    this being another question hard to answer  mr  jarvis lorry withdrew to consider it      v  the wine shop   a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken  in the street  the accident had happened in getting it out of a cart  the cask had tumbled out with a run  the hoops had burst  and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine shop  shattered like a walnut shell   all the people within reach had suspended their business  or their idleness  to run to the spot and drink the wine  the rough  irregular stones of the street  pointing every way  and designed  one might have thought  expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them  had dammed it into little pools  these were surrounded  each by its own jostling group or crowd  according to its size  some men kneeled down  made scoops of their two hands joined  and sipped  or tried to help women  who bent over their shoulders  to sip  before the wine had all run out between their fingers  others  men and women  dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware  or even with handkerchiefs from women s heads  which were squeezed dry into infants  mouths  others made small mud embankments  to stem the wine as it ran  others  directed by lookers on up at high windows  darted here and there  to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions  others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee dyed pieces of the cask  licking  and even champing the moister wine rotted fragments with eager relish  there was no drainage to carry off the wine  and not only did it all get taken up  but so much mud got taken up along with it  that there might have been a scavenger in the street  if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence   a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices  voices of men  women  and children  resounded in the street while this wine game lasted  there was little roughness in the sport  and much playfulness  there was a special companionship in it  an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one  which led  especially among the luckier or lighter hearted  to frolicsome embraces  drinking of healths  shaking of hands  and even joining of hands and dancing  a dozen together  when the wine was gone  and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron pattern by fingers  these demonstrations ceased  as suddenly as they had broken out  the man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting  set it in motion again  the women who had left on a door step the little pot of hot ashes  at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes  or in those of her child  returned to it  men with bare arms  matted locks  and cadaverous faces  who had emerged into the winter light from cellars  moved away  to descend again  and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine   the wine was red wine  and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of saint antoine  in paris  where it was spilled  it had stained many hands  too  and many faces  and many naked feet  and many wooden shoes  the hands of the man who sawed the wood  left red marks on the billets  and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby  was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again  those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask  had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth  and one tall joker so besmirched  his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it  scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine lees  blood   the time was to come  when that wine too would be spilled on the street stones  and when the stain of it would be red upon many there   and now that the cloud settled on saint antoine  which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance  the darkness of it was heavy  cold  dirt  sickness  ignorance  and want  were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence  nobles of great power all of them  but  most especially the last  samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill  and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young  shivered at every corner  passed in and out at every doorway  looked from every window  fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook  the mill which had worked them down  was the mill that grinds young people old  the children had ancient faces and grave voices  and upon them  and upon the grown faces  and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh  was the sigh  hunger  it was prevalent everywhere  hunger was pushed out of the tall houses  in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines  hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper  hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off  hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys  and started up from the filthy street that had no offal  among its refuse  of anything to eat  hunger was the inscription on the baker s shelves  written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread  at the sausage shop  in every dead dog preparation that was offered for sale  hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder  hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato  fried with some reluctant drops of oil   its abiding place was in all things fitted to it  a narrow winding street  full of offence and stench  with other narrow winding streets diverging  all peopled by rags and nightcaps  and all smelling of rags and nightcaps  and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill  in the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay  depressed and slinking though they were  eyes of fire were not wanting among them  nor compressed lips  white with what they suppressed  nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows rope they mused about enduring  or inflicting  the trade signs  and they were almost as many as the shops  were  all  grim illustrations of want  the butcher and the porkman painted up  only the leanest scrags of meat  the baker  the coarsest of meagre loaves  the people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine shops  croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer  and were gloweringly confidential together  nothing was represented in a flourishing condition  save tools and weapons  but  the cutler s knives and axes were sharp and bright  the smith s hammers were heavy  and the gunmaker s stock was murderous  the crippling stones of the pavement  with their many little reservoirs of mud and water  had no footways  but broke off abruptly at the doors  the kennel  to make amends  ran down the middle of the street  when it ran at all  which was only after heavy rains  and then it ran  by many eccentric fits  into the houses  across the streets  at wide intervals  one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley  at night  when the lamplighter had let these down  and lighted  and hoisted them again  a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead  as if they were at sea  indeed they were at sea  and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest   for  the time was to come  when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter  in their idleness and hunger  so long  as to conceive the idea of improving on his method  and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys  to flare upon the darkness of their condition  but  the time was not come yet  and every wind that blew over france shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain  for the birds  fine of song and feather  took no warning   the wine shop was a corner shop  better than most others in its appearance and degree  and the master of the wine shop had stood outside it  in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches  looking on at the struggle for the lost wine   it s not my affair   said he  with a final shrug of the shoulders   the people from the market did it  let them bring another    there  his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke  he called to him across the way    say  then  my gaspard  what do you do there    the fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance  as is often the way with his tribe  it missed its mark  and completely failed  as is often the way with his tribe too    what now  are you a subject for the mad hospital   said the wine shop keeper  crossing the road  and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud  picked up for the purpose  and smeared over it   why do you write in the public streets  is there  tell me thou  is there no other place to write such words in    in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand  perhaps accidentally  perhaps not  upon the joker s heart  the joker rapped it with his own  took a nimble spring upward  and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude  with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand  and held out  a joker of an extremely  not to say wolfishly practical character  he looked  under those circumstances    put it on  put it on   said the other   call wine  wine  and finish there   with that advice  he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker s dress  such as it was  quite deliberately  as having dirtied the hand on his account  and then recrossed the road and entered the wine shop   this wine shop keeper was a bull necked  martial looking man of thirty  and he should have been of a hot temperament  for  although it was a bitter day  he wore no coat  but carried one slung over his shoulder  his shirt sleeves were rolled up  too  and his brown arms were bare to the elbows  neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply curling short dark hair  he was a dark man altogether  with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them  good humoured looking on the whole  but implacable looking  too  evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose  a man not desirable to be met  rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side  for nothing would turn the man   madame defarge  his wife  sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in  madame defarge was a stout woman of about his own age  with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything  a large hand heavily ringed  a steady face  strong features  and great composure of manner  there was a character about madame defarge  from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided  madame defarge being sensitive to cold  was wrapped in fur  and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head  though not to the concealment of her large earrings  her knitting was before her  but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick  thus engaged  with her right elbow supported by her left hand  madame defarge said nothing when her lord came in  but coughed just one grain of cough  this  in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line  suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers  for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way   the wine shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about  until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady  who were seated in a corner  other company were there  two playing cards  two playing dominoes  three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine  as he passed behind the counter  he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady   this is our man     what the devil do you do in that galley there   said monsieur defarge to himself   i don t know you    but  he feigned not to notice the two strangers  and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter    how goes it  jacques   said one of these three to monsieur defarge   is all the spilt wine swallowed     every drop  jacques   answered monsieur defarge   when this interchange of christian name was effected  madame defarge  picking her teeth with her toothpick  coughed another grain of cough  and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line    it is not often   said the second of the three  addressing monsieur defarge   that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine  or of anything but black bread and death  is it not so  jacques     it is so  jacques   monsieur defarge returned   at this second interchange of the christian name  madame defarge  still using her toothpick with profound composure  coughed another grain of cough  and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line   the last of the three now said his say  as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips    ah  so much the worse  a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths  and hard lives they live  jacques  am i right  jacques     you are right  jacques   was the response of monsieur defarge   this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment when madame defarge put her toothpick by  kept her eyebrows up  and slightly rustled in her seat    hold then  true   muttered her husband   gentlemen  my wife    the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge  with three flourishes  she acknowledged their homage by bending her head  and giving them a quick look  then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine shop  took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit  and became absorbed in it    gentlemen   said her husband  who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her   good day  the chamber  furnished bachelor fashion  that you wished to see  and were inquiring for when i stepped out  is on the fifth floor  the doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here   pointing with his hand   near to the window of my establishment  but  now that i remember  one of you has already been there  and can show the way  gentlemen  adieu    they paid for their wine  and left the place  the eyes of monsieur defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner  and begged the favour of a word    willingly  sir   said monsieur defarge  and quietly stepped with him to the door   their conference was very short  but very decided  almost at the first word  monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive  it had not lasted a minute  when he nodded and went out  the gentleman then beckoned to the young lady  and they  too  went out  madame defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows  and saw nothing   mr  jarvis lorry and miss manette  emerging from the wine shop thus  joined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before  it opened from a stinking little black courtyard  and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses  inhabited by a great number of people  in the gloomy tile paved entry to the gloomy tile paved staircase  monsieur defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master  and put her hand to his lips  it was a gentle action  but not at all gently done  a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds  he had no good humour in his face  nor any openness of aspect left  but had become a secret  angry  dangerous man    it is very high  it is a little difficult  better to begin slowly    thus  monsieur defarge  in a stern voice  to mr  lorry  as they began ascending the stairs    is he alone   the latter whispered    alone  god help him  who should be with him   said the other  in the same low voice    is he always alone  then     yes     of his own desire     of his own necessity  as he was  when i first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if i would take him  and  at my peril be discreet  as he was then  so he is now     he is greatly changed     changed    the keeper of the wine shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand  and mutter a tremendous curse  no direct answer could have been half so forcible  mr  lorry s spirits grew heavier and heavier  as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher   such a staircase  with its accessories  in the older and more crowded parts of paris  would be bad enough now  but  at that time  it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses  every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building  that is to say  the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase  left its own heap of refuse on its own landing  besides flinging other refuse from its own windows  the uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered  would have polluted the air  even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities  the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable  through such an atmosphere  by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison  the way lay  yielding to his own disturbance of mind  and to his young companion s agitation  which became greater every instant  mr  jarvis lorry twice stopped to rest  each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating  by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted  seemed to escape  and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in  through the rusted bars  tastes  rather than glimpses  were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood  and nothing within range  nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of notre dame  had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations   at last  the top of the staircase was gained  and they stopped for the third time  there was yet an upper staircase  of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions  to be ascended  before the garret story was reached  the keeper of the wine shop  always going a little in advance  and always going on the side which mr  lorry took  as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady  turned himself about here  and  carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder  took out a key    the door is locked then  my friend   said mr  lorry  surprised    ay  yes   was the grim reply of monsieur defarge    you think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired     i think it necessary to turn the key   monsieur defarge whispered it closer in his ear  and frowned heavily    why     why  because he has lived so long  locked up  that he would be frightened  rave  tear himself to pieces  die  come to i know not what harm  if his door was left open     is it possible   exclaimed mr  lorry    is it possible   repeated defarge  bitterly   yes  and a beautiful world we live in  when it is possible  and when many other such things are possible  and not only possible  but done  done  see you   under that sky there  every day  long live the devil  let us go on    this dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper  that not a word of it had reached the young lady s ears  but  by this time she trembled under such strong emotion  and her face expressed such deep anxiety  and  above all  such dread and terror  that mr  lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance    courage  dear miss  courage  business  the worst will be over in a moment  it is but passing the room door  and the worst is over  then  all the good you bring to him  all the relief  all the happiness you bring to him  begin  let our good friend here  assist you on that side  that s well  friend defarge  come  now  business  business    they went up slowly and softly  the staircase was short  and they were soon at the top  there  as it had an abrupt turn in it  they came all at once in sight of three men  whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door  and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged  through some chinks or holes in the wall  on hearing footsteps close at hand  these three turned  and rose  and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine shop    i forgot them in the surprise of your visit   explained monsieur defarge   leave us  good boys  we have business here    the three glided by  and went silently down   there appearing to be no other door on that floor  and the keeper of the wine shop going straight to this one when they were left alone  mr  lorry asked him in a whisper  with a little anger    do you make a show of monsieur manette     i show him  in the way you have seen  to a chosen few     is that well     i think it is well     who are the few  how do you choose them     i choose them as real men  of my name  jacques is my name  to whom the sight is likely to do good  enough  you are english  that is another thing  stay there  if you please  a little moment    with an admonitory gesture to keep them back  he stooped  and looked in through the crevice in the wall  soon raising his head again  he struck twice or thrice upon the door  evidently with no other object than to make a noise there  with the same intention  he drew the key across it  three or four times  before he put it clumsily into the lock  and turned it as heavily as he could   the door slowly opened inward under his hand  and he looked into the room and said something  a faint voice answered something  little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side   he looked back over his shoulder  and beckoned them to enter  mr  lorry got his arm securely round the daughter s waist  and held her  for he felt that she was sinking    a a a business  business   he urged  with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek   come in  come in     i am afraid of it   she answered  shuddering    of it  what     i mean of him  of my father    rendered in a manner desperate  by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor  he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder  lifted her a little  and hurried her into the room  he sat her down just within the door  and held her  clinging to him   defarge drew out the key  closed the door  locked it on the inside  took out the key again  and held it in his hand  all this he did  methodically  and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make  finally  he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was  he stopped there  and faced round   the garret  built to be a depository for firewood and the like  was dim and dark  for  the window of dormer shape  was in truth a door in the roof  with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street  unglazed  and closing up the middle in two pieces  like any other door of french construction  to exclude the cold  one half of this door was fast closed  and the other was opened but a very little way  such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means  that it was difficult  on first coming in  to see anything  and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one  the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity  yet  work of that kind was being done in the garret  for  with his back towards the door  and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine shop stood looking at him  a white haired man sat on a low bench  stooping forward and very busy  making shoes      vi  the shoemaker    good day   said monsieur defarge  looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking   it was raised for a moment  and a very faint voice responded to the salutation  as if it were at a distance    good day     you are still hard at work  i see    after a long silence  the head was lifted for another moment  and the voice replied   yes  i am working   this time  a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner  before the face had dropped again   the faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful  it was not the faintness of physical weakness  though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it  its deplorable peculiarity was  that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse  it was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago  so entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice  that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain  so sunken and suppressed it was  that it was like a voice underground  so expressive it was  of a hopeless and lost creature  that a famished traveller  wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness  would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die   some minutes of silent work had passed  and the haggard eyes had looked up again  not with any interest or curiosity  but with a dull mechanical perception  beforehand  that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood  was not yet empty    i want   said defarge  who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker   to let in a little more light here  you can bear a little more    the shoemaker stopped his work  looked with a vacant air of listening  at the floor on one side of him  then similarly  at the floor on the other side of him  then  upward at the speaker    what did you say     you can bear a little more light     i must bear it  if you let it in    laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word    the opened half door was opened a little further  and secured at that angle for the time  a broad ray of light fell into the garret  and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap  pausing in his labour  his few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench  he had a white beard  raggedly cut  but not very long  a hollow face  and exceedingly bright eyes  the hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large  under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair  though they had been really otherwise  but  they were naturally large  and looked unnaturally so  his yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat  and showed his body to be withered and worn  he  and his old canvas frock  and his loose stockings  and all his poor tatters of clothes  had  in a long seclusion from direct light and air  faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment yellow  that it would have been hard to say which was which   he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light  and the very bones of it seemed transparent  so he sat  with a steadfastly vacant gaze  pausing in his work  he never looked at the figure before him  without first looking down on this side of himself  then on that  as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound  he never spoke  without first wandering in this manner  and forgetting to speak    are you going to finish that pair of shoes to day   asked defarge  motioning to mr  lorry to come forward    what did you say     do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to day     i can t say that i mean to  i suppose so  i don t know    but  the question reminded him of his work  and he bent over it again   mr  lorry came silently forward  leaving the daughter by the door  when he had stood  for a minute or two  by the side of defarge  the shoemaker looked up  he showed no surprise at seeing another figure  but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it  his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead colour   and then the hand dropped to his work  and he once more bent over the shoe  the look and the action had occupied but an instant    you have a visitor  you see   said monsieur defarge    what did you say     here is a visitor    the shoemaker looked up as before  but without removing a hand from his work    come   said defarge   here is monsieur  who knows a well made shoe when he sees one  show him that shoe you are working at  take it  monsieur    mr  lorry took it in his hand    tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is  and the maker s name    there was a longer pause than usual  before the shoemaker replied    i forget what it was you asked me  what did you say     i said  couldn t you describe the kind of shoe  for monsieur s information     it is a lady s shoe  it is a young lady s walking shoe  it is in the present mode  i never saw the mode  i have had a pattern in my hand   he glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride    and the maker s name   said defarge   now that he had no work to hold  he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left  and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right  and then passed a hand across his bearded chin  and so on in regular changes  without a moment s intermission  the task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken  was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon  or endeavouring  in the hope of some disclosure  to stay the spirit of a fast dying man    did you ask me for my name     assuredly i did     one hundred and five  north tower     is that all     one hundred and five  north tower    with a weary sound that was not a sigh  nor a groan  he bent to work again  until the silence was again broken    you are not a shoemaker by trade   said mr  lorry  looking steadfastly at him   his haggard eyes turned to defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him  but as no help came from that quarter  they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground    i am not a shoemaker by trade  no  i was not a shoemaker by trade  i i learnt it here  i taught myself  i asked leave to     he lapsed away  even for minutes  ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time  his eyes came slowly back  at last  to the face from which they had wandered  when they rested on it  he started  and resumed  in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake  reverting to a subject of last night    i asked leave to teach myself  and i got it with much difficulty after a long while  and i have made shoes ever since    as he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him  mr  lorry said  still looking steadfastly in his face    monsieur manette  do you remember nothing of me    the shoe dropped to the ground  and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner    monsieur manette   mr  lorry laid his hand upon defarge s arm   do you remember nothing of this man  look at him  look at me  is there no old banker  no old business  no old servant  no old time  rising in your mind  monsieur manette    as the captive of many years sat looking fixedly  by turns  at mr  lorry and at defarge  some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead  gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him  they were overclouded again  they were fainter  they were gone  but they had been there  and so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him  and where she now stood looking at him  with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion  if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him  but which were now extending towards him  trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast  and love it back to life and hope  so exactly was the expression repeated  though in stronger characters  on her fair young face  that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light  from him to her   darkness had fallen on him in its place  he looked at the two  less and less attentively  and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way  finally  with a deep long sigh  he took the shoe up  and resumed his work    have you recognised him  monsieur   asked defarge in a whisper    yes  for a moment  at first i thought it quite hopeless  but i have unquestionably seen  for a single moment  the face that i once knew so well  hush  let us draw further back  hush    she had moved from the wall of the garret  very near to the bench on which he sat  there was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour   not a word was spoken  not a sound was made  she stood  like a spirit  beside him  and he bent over his work   it happened  at length  that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand  for his shoemaker s knife  it lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood  he had taken it up  and was stooping to work again  when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress  he raised them  and saw her face  the two spectators started forward  but she stayed them with a motion of her hand  she had no fear of his striking at her with the knife  though they had   he stared at her with a fearful look  and after a while his lips began to form some words  though no sound proceeded from them  by degrees  in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing  he was heard to say    what is this    with the tears streaming down her face  she put her two hands to her lips  and kissed them to him  then clasped them on her breast  as if she laid his ruined head there    you are not the gaoler s daughter    she sighed  no     who are you    not yet trusting the tones of her voice  she sat down on the bench beside him  he recoiled  but she laid her hand upon his arm  a strange thrill struck him when she did so  and visibly passed over his frame  he laid the knife down softly  as he sat staring at her   her golden hair  which she wore in long curls  had been hurriedly pushed aside  and fell down over her neck  advancing his hand by little and little  he took it up and looked at it  in the midst of the action he went astray  and  with another deep sigh  fell to work at his shoemaking   but not for long  releasing his arm  she laid her hand upon his shoulder  after looking doubtfully at it  two or three times  as if to be sure that it was really there  he laid down his work  put his hand to his neck  and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it  he opened this  carefully  on his knee  and it contained a very little quantity of hair  not more than one or two long golden hairs  which he had  in some old day  wound off upon his finger   he took her hair into his hand again  and looked closely at it   it is the same  how can it be  when was it  how was it    as the concentrated expression returned to his forehead  he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too  he turned her full to the light  and looked at her    she had laid her head upon my shoulder  that night when i was summoned out  she had a fear of my going  though i had none  and when i was brought to the north tower they found these upon my sleeve   you will leave me them  they can never help me to escape in the body  though they may in the spirit   those were the words i said  i remember them very well    he formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it  but when he did find spoken words for it  they came to him coherently  though slowly    how was this   was it you    once more  the two spectators started  as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness  but she sat perfectly still in his grasp  and only said  in a low voice   i entreat you  good gentlemen  do not come near us  do not speak  do not move     hark   he exclaimed   whose voice was that    his hands released her as he uttered this cry  and went up to his white hair  which they tore in a frenzy  it died out  as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him  and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast  but he still looked at her  and gloomily shook his head    no  no  no  you are too young  too blooming  it can t be  see what the prisoner is  these are not the hands she knew  this is not the face she knew  this is not a voice she ever heard  no  no  she was  and he was  before the slow years of the north tower  ages ago  what is your name  my gentle angel    hailing his softened tone and manner  his daughter fell upon her knees before him  with her appealing hands upon his breast    o  sir  at another time you shall know my name  and who my mother was  and who my father  and how i never knew their hard  hard history  but i cannot tell you at this time  and i cannot tell you here  all that i may tell you  here and now  is  that i pray to you to touch me and to bless me  kiss me  kiss me  o my dear  my dear    his cold white head mingled with her radiant hair  which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of freedom shining on him    if you hear in my voice  i don t know that it is so  but i hope it is  if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears  weep for it  weep for it  if you touch  in touching my hair  anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free  weep for it  weep for it  if  when i hint to you of a home that is before us  where i will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service  i bring back the remembrance of a home long desolate  while your poor heart pined away  weep for it  weep for it    she held him closer round the neck  and rocked him on her breast like a child    if  when i tell you  dearest dear  that your agony is over  and that i have come here to take you from it  and that we go to england to be at peace and at rest  i cause you to think of your useful life laid waste  and of our native france so wicked to you  weep for it  weep for it  and if  when i shall tell you of my name  and of my father who is living  and of my mother who is dead  you learn that i have to kneel to my honoured father  and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night  because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me  weep for it  weep for it  weep for her  then  and for me  good gentlemen  thank god  i feel his sacred tears upon my face  and his sobs strike against my heart  o  see  thank god for us  thank god    he had sunk in her arms  and his face dropped on her breast  a sight so touching  yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it  that the two beholders covered their faces   when the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed  and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all storms  emblem to humanity  of the rest and silence into which the storm called life must hush at last  they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground  he had gradually dropped to the floor  and lay there in a lethargy  worn out  she had nestled down with him  that his head might lie upon her arm  and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light    if  without disturbing him   she said  raising her hand to mr  lorry as he stooped over them  after repeated blowings of his nose   all could be arranged for our leaving paris at once  so that  from the very door  he could be taken away      but  consider  is he fit for the journey   asked mr  lorry    more fit for that  i think  than to remain in this city  so dreadful to him     it is true   said defarge  who was kneeling to look on and hear   more than that  monsieur manette is  for all reasons  best out of france  say  shall i hire a carriage and post horses     that s business   said mr  lorry  resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners   and if business is to be done  i had better do it     then be so kind   urged miss manette   as to leave us here  you see how composed he has become  and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now  why should you be  if you will lock the door to secure us from interruption  i do not doubt that you will find him  when you come back  as quiet as you leave him  in any case  i will take care of him until you return  and then we will remove him straight    both mr  lorry and defarge were rather disinclined to this course  and in favour of one of them remaining  but  as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to  but travelling papers  and as time pressed  for the day was drawing to an end  it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done  and hurrying away to do it   then  as the darkness closed in  the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father s side  and watched him  the darkness deepened and deepened  and they both lay quiet  until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall   mr  lorry and monsieur defarge had made all ready for the journey  and had brought with them  besides travelling cloaks and wrappers  bread and meat  wine  and hot coffee  monsieur defarge put this provender  and the lamp he carried  on the shoemaker s bench  there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed   and he and mr  lorry roused the captive  and assisted him to his feet   no human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind  in the scared blank wonder of his face  whether he knew what had happened  whether he recollected what they had said to him  whether he knew that he was free  were questions which no sagacity could have solved  they tried speaking to him  but  he was so confused  and so very slow to answer  that they took fright at his bewilderment  and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more  he had a wild  lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands  that had not been seen in him before  yet  he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter s voice  and invariably turned to it when she spoke   in the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion  he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink  and put on the cloak and other wrappings  that they gave him to wear  he readily responded to his daughter s drawing her arm through his  and took  and kept  her hand in both his own   they began to descend  monsieur defarge going first with the lamp  mr  lorry closing the little procession  they had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped  and stared at the roof and round at the walls    you remember the place  my father  you remember coming up here     what did you say    but  before she could repeat the question  he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it    remember  no  i don t remember  it was so very long ago    that he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house  was apparent to them  they heard him mutter   one hundred and five  north tower   and when he looked about him  it evidently was for the strong fortress walls which had long encompassed him  on their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread  as being in expectation of a drawbridge  and when there was no drawbridge  and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street  he dropped his daughter s hand and clasped his head again   no crowd was about the door  no people were discernible at any of the many windows  not even a chance passerby was in the street  an unnatural silence and desertion reigned there  only one soul was to be seen  and that was madame defarge  who leaned against the door post  knitting  and saw nothing   the prisoner had got into a coach  and his daughter had followed him  when mr  lorry s feet were arrested on the step by his asking  miserably  for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes  madame defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them  and went  knitting  out of the lamplight  through the courtyard  she quickly brought them down and handed them in   and immediately afterwards leaned against the door post  knitting  and saw nothing   defarge got upon the box  and gave the word  to the barrier   the postilion cracked his whip  and they clattered away under the feeble over swinging lamps   under the over swinging lamps  swinging ever brighter in the better streets  and ever dimmer in the worse  and by lighted shops  gay crowds  illuminated coffee houses  and theatre doors  to one of the city gates  soldiers with lanterns  at the guard house there   your papers  travellers    see here then  monsieur the officer   said defarge  getting down  and taking him gravely apart   these are the papers of monsieur inside  with the white head  they were consigned to me  with him  at the    he dropped his voice  there was a flutter among the military lanterns  and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform  the eyes connected with the arm looked  not an every day or an every night look  at monsieur with the white head   it is well  forward   from the uniform   adieu   from defarge  and so  under a short grove of feebler and feebler over swinging lamps  out under the great grove of stars   beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights  some  so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it  as a point in space where anything is suffered or done  the shadows of the night were broad and black  all through the cold and restless interval  until dawn  they once more whispered in the ears of mr  jarvis lorry  sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out  and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him  and what were capable of restoration  the old inquiry    i hope you care to be recalled to life    and the old answer    i can t say     the end of the first book       book the second  the golden thread     i  five years later   tellson s bank by temple bar was an old fashioned place  even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty  it was very small  very dark  very ugly  very incommodious  it was an old fashioned place  moreover  in the moral attribute that the partners in the house were proud of its smallness  proud of its darkness  proud of its ugliness  proud of its incommodiousness  they were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars  and were fired by an express conviction that  if it were less objectionable  it would be less respectable  this was no passive belief  but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business  tellson s  they said  wanted no elbow room  tellson s wanted no light  tellson s wanted no embellishment  noakes and co  s might  or snooks brothers  might  but tellson s  thank heaven     any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding tellson s  in this respect the house was much on a par with the country  which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable  but were only the more respectable   thus it had come to pass  that tellson s was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience  after bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat  you fell into tellson s down two steps  and came to your senses in a miserable little shop  with two little counters  where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it  while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows  which were always under a shower bath of mud from fleet street  and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper  and the heavy shadow of temple bar  if your business necessitated your seeing  the house   you were put into a species of condemned hold at the back  where you meditated on a misspent life  until the house came with its hands in its pockets  and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight  your money came out of  or went into  wormy old wooden drawers  particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut  your bank notes had a musty odour  as if they were fast decomposing into rags again  your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools  and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two  your deeds got into extemporised strong rooms made of kitchens and sculleries  and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking house air  your lighter boxes of family papers went up stairs into a barmecide room  that always had a great dining table in it and never had a dinner  and where  even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty  the first letters written to you by your old love  or by your little children  were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows  by the heads exposed on temple bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of abyssinia or ashantee   but indeed  at that time  putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions  and not least of all with tellson s  death is nature s remedy for all things  and why not legislation s  accordingly  the forger was put to death  the utterer of a bad note was put to death  the unlawful opener of a letter was put to death  the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to death  the holder of a horse at tellson s door  who made off with it  was put to death  the coiner of a bad shilling was put to death  the sounders of three fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of crime  were put to death  not that it did the least good in the way of prevention  it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse  but  it cleared off  as to this world  the trouble of each particular case  and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after  thus  tellson s  in its day  like greater places of business  its contemporaries  had taken so many lives  that  if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on temple bar instead of being privately disposed of  they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had  in a rather significant manner   cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at tellson s  the oldest of men carried on the business gravely  when they took a young man into tellson s london house  they hid him somewhere till he was old  they kept him in a dark place  like a cheese  until he had the full tellson flavour and blue mould upon him  then only was he permitted to be seen  spectacularly poring over large books  and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment   outside tellson s  never by any means in it  unless called in  was an odd job man  an occasional porter and messenger  who served as the live sign of the house  he was never absent during business hours  unless upon an errand  and then he was represented by his son  a grisly urchin of twelve  who was his express image  people understood that tellson s  in a stately way  tolerated the odd job man  the house had always tolerated some person in that capacity  and time and tide had drifted this person to the post  his surname was cruncher  and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness  in the easterly parish church of hounsditch  he had received the added appellation of jerry   the scene was mr  cruncher s private lodging in hanging sword alley  whitefriars  the time  half past seven of the clock on a windy march morning  anno domini seventeen hundred and eighty   mr  cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our lord as anna dominoes  apparently under the impression that the christian era dated from the invention of a popular game  by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it    mr  cruncher s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood  and were but two in number  even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one  but they were very decently kept  early as it was  on the windy march morning  the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout  and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast  and the lumbering deal table  a very clean white cloth was spread   mr  cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane  like a harlequin at home  at first  he slept heavily  but  by degrees  began to roll and surge in bed  until he rose above the surface  with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons  at which juncture  he exclaimed  in a voice of dire exasperation    bust me  if she ain t at it agin    a woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner  with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to    what   said mr  cruncher  looking out of bed for a boot   you re at it agin  are you    after hailing the morn with this second salutation  he threw a boot at the woman as a third  it was a very muddy boot  and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with mr  cruncher s domestic economy  that  whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots  he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay    what   said mr  cruncher  varying his apostrophe after missing his mark   what are you up to  aggerawayter     i was only saying my prayers     saying your prayers  you re a nice woman  what do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me     i was not praying against you  i was praying for you     you weren t  and if you were  i won t be took the liberty with  here  your mother s a nice woman  young jerry  going a praying agin your father s prosperity  you ve got a dutiful mother  you have  my son  you ve got a religious mother  you have  my boy  going and flopping herself down  and praying that the bread and butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child    master cruncher  who was in his shirt  took this very ill  and  turning to his mother  strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board    and what do you suppose  you conceited female   said mr  cruncher  with unconscious inconsistency   that the worth of your prayers may be  name the price that you put your prayers at     they only come from the heart  jerry  they are worth no more than that     worth no more than that   repeated mr  cruncher   they ain t worth much  then  whether or no  i won t be prayed agin  i tell you  i can t afford it  i m not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking  if you must go flopping yourself down  flop in favour of your husband and child  and not in opposition to  em  if i had had any but a unnat ral wife  and this poor boy had had any but a unnat ral mother  i might have made some money last week instead of being counter prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck  b u u ust me   said mr  cruncher  who all this time had been putting on his clothes   if i ain t  what with piety and one blowed thing and another  been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with  young jerry  dress yourself  my boy  and while i clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then  and if you see any signs of more flopping  give me a call  for  i tell you   here he addressed his wife once more   i won t be gone agin  in this manner  i am as rickety as a hackney coach  i m as sleepy as laudanum  my lines is strained to that degree that i shouldn t know  if it wasn t for the pain in  em  which was me and which somebody else  yet i m none the better for it in pocket  and it s my suspicion that you ve been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket  and i won t put up with it  aggerawayter  and what do you say now    growling  in addition  such phrases as  ah  yes  you re religious  too  you wouldn t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child  would you  not you   and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation  mr  cruncher betook himself to his boot cleaning and his general preparation for business  in the meantime  his son  whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes  and whose young eyes stood close by one another  as his father s did  kept the required watch upon his mother  he greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals  by darting out of his sleeping closet  where he made his toilet  with a suppressed cry of  you are going to flop  mother    halloa  father   and  after raising this fictitious alarm  darting in again with an undutiful grin   mr  cruncher s temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast  he resented mrs  cruncher s saying grace with particular animosity    now  aggerawayter  what are you up to  at it again    his wife explained that she had merely  asked a blessing     don t do it   said mr  crunches looking about  as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife s petitions   i ain t a going to be blest out of house and home  i won t have my wittles blest off my table  keep still    exceedingly red eyed and grim  as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn  jerry cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it  growling over it like any four footed inmate of a menagerie  towards nine o clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect  and  presenting as respectable and business like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with  issued forth to the occupation of the day   it could scarcely be called a trade  in spite of his favourite description of himself as  a honest tradesman   his stock consisted of a wooden stool  made out of a broken backed chair cut down  which stool  young jerry  walking at his father s side  carried every morning to beneath the banking house window that was nearest temple bar  where  with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd job man s feet  it formed the encampment for the day  on this post of his  mr  cruncher was as well known to fleet street and the temple  as the bar itself   and was almost as in looking   encamped at a quarter before nine  in good time to touch his three cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to tellson s  jerry took up his station on this windy march morning  with young jerry standing by him  when not engaged in making forays through the bar  to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose  father and son  extremely like each other  looking silently on at the morning traffic in fleet street  with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were  bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys  the resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance  that the mature jerry bit and spat out straw  while the twinkling eyes of the youthful jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in fleet street   the head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to tellson s establishment was put through the door  and the word was given    porter wanted     hooray  father  here s an early job to begin with    having thus given his parent god speed  young jerry seated himself on the stool  entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing  and cogitated    al ways rusty  his fingers is al ways rusty   muttered young jerry   where does my father get all that iron rust from  he don t get no iron rust here       ii  a sight    you know the old bailey well  no doubt   said one of the oldest of clerks to jerry the messenger    ye es  sir   returned jerry  in something of a dogged manner   i do know the bailey     just so  and you know mr  lorry     i know mr  lorry  sir  much better than i know the bailey  much better   said jerry  not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question   than i  as a honest tradesman  wish to know the bailey     very well  find the door where the witnesses go in  and show the door keeper this note for mr  lorry  he will then let you in     into the court  sir     into the court    mr  cruncher s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another  and to interchange the inquiry   what do you think of this     am i to wait in the court  sir   he asked  as the result of that conference    i am going to tell you  the door keeper will pass the note to mr  lorry  and do you make any gesture that will attract mr  lorry s attention  and show him where you stand  then what you have to do  is  to remain there until he wants you     is that all  sir     that s all  he wishes to have a messenger at hand  this is to tell him you are there    as the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note  mr  cruncher  after surveying him in silence until he came to the blotting paper stage  remarked    i suppose they ll be trying forgeries this morning     treason     that s quartering   said jerry   barbarous     it is the law   remarked the ancient clerk  turning his surprised spectacles upon him   it is the law     it s hard in the law to spile a man  i think  it s hard enough to kill him  but it s wery hard to spile him  sir     not at all   retained the ancient clerk   speak well of the law  take care of your chest and voice  my good friend  and leave the law to take care of itself  i give you that advice     it s the damp  sir  what settles on my chest and voice   said jerry   i leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is     well  well   said the old clerk   we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood  some of us have damp ways  and some of us have dry ways  here is the letter  go along    jerry took the letter  and  remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of   you are a lean old one  too   made his bow  informed his son  in passing  of his destination  and went his way   they hanged at tyburn  in those days  so the street outside newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it  but  the gaol was a vile place  in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised  and where dire diseases were bred  that came into court with the prisoners  and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my lord chief justice himself  and pulled him off the bench  it had more than once happened  that the judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner s  and even died before him  for the rest  the old bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn yard  from which pale travellers set out continually  in carts and coaches  on a violent passage into the other world  traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road  and shaming few good citizens  if any  so powerful is use  and so desirable to be good use in the beginning  it was famous  too  for the pillory  a wise old institution  that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent  also  for the whipping post  another dear old institution  very humanising and softening to behold in action  also  for extensive transactions in blood money  another fragment of ancestral wisdom  systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under heaven  altogether  the old bailey  at that date  was a choice illustration of the precept  that  whatever is is right   an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy  did it not include the troublesome consequence  that nothing that ever was  was wrong   making his way through the tainted crowd  dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action  with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly  the messenger found out the door he sought  and handed in his letter through a trap in it  for  people then paid to see the play at the old bailey  just as they paid to see the play in bedlam  only the former entertainment was much the dearer  therefore  all the old bailey doors were well guarded  except  indeed  the social doors by which the criminals got there  and those were always left wide open   after some delay and demur  the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way  and allowed mr  jerry cruncher to squeeze himself into court    what s on   he asked  in a whisper  of the man he found himself next to    nothing yet     what s coming on     the treason case     the quartering one  eh     ah   returned the man  with a relish   he ll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged  and then he ll be taken down and sliced before his own face  and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on  and then his head will be chopped off  and he ll be cut into quarters  that s the sentence     if he s found guilty  you mean to say   jerry added  by way of proviso    oh  they ll find him guilty   said the other   don t you be afraid of that    mr  cruncher s attention was here diverted to the door keeper  whom he saw making his way to mr  lorry  with the note in his hand  mr  lorry sat at a table  among the gentlemen in wigs  not far from a wigged gentleman  the prisoner s counsel  who had a great bundle of papers before him  and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets  whose whole attention  when mr  cruncher looked at him then or afterwards  seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court  after some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand  jerry attracted the notice of mr  lorry  who had stood up to look for him  and who quietly nodded and sat down again    what s he got to do with the case   asked the man he had spoken with    blest if i know   said jerry    what have you got to do with it  then  if a person may inquire     blest if i know that either   said jerry   the entrance of the judge  and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court  stopped the dialogue  presently  the dock became the central point of interest  two gaolers  who had been standing there  went out  and the prisoner was brought in  and put to the bar   everybody present  except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling  stared at him  all the human breath in the place  rolled at him  like a sea  or a wind  or a fire  eager faces strained round pillars and corners  to get a sight of him  spectators in back rows stood up  not to miss a hair of him  people on the floor of the court  laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them  to help themselves  at anybody s cost  to a view of him  stood a tiptoe  got upon ledges  stood upon next to nothing  to see every inch of him  conspicuous among these latter  like an animated bit of the spiked wall of newgate  jerry stood  aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along  and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer  and gin  and tea  and coffee  and what not  that flowed at him  and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain   the object of all this staring and blaring  was a young man of about five and twenty  well grown and well looking  with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye  his condition was that of a young gentleman  he was plainly dressed in black  or very dark grey  and his hair  which was long and dark  was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck  more to be out of his way than for ornament  as an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body  so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek  showing the soul to be stronger than the sun  he was otherwise quite self possessed  bowed to the judge  and stood quiet   the sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at  was not a sort that elevated humanity  had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentence  had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being spared  by just so much would he have lost in his fascination  the form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled  was the sight  the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder  yielded the sensation  whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest  according to their several arts and powers of self deceit  the interest was  at the root of it  ogreish   silence in the court  charles darnay had yesterday pleaded not guilty to an indictment denouncing him  with infinite jingle and jangle  for that he was a false traitor to our serene  illustrious  excellent  and so forth  prince  our lord the king  by reason of his having  on divers occasions  and by divers means and ways  assisted lewis  the french king  in his wars against our said serene  illustrious  excellent  and so forth  that was to say  by coming and going  between the dominions of our said serene  illustrious  excellent  and so forth  and those of the said french lewis  and wickedly  falsely  traitorously  and otherwise evil adverbiously  revealing to the said french lewis what forces our said serene  illustrious  excellent  and so forth  had in preparation to send to canada and north america  this much  jerry  with his head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it  made out with huge satisfaction  and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid  and over and over again aforesaid  charles darnay  stood there before him upon his trial  that the jury were swearing in  and that mr  attorney general was making ready to speak   the accused  who was  and who knew he was  being mentally hanged  beheaded  and quartered  by everybody there  neither flinched from the situation  nor assumed any theatrical air in it  he was quiet and attentive  watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest  and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him  so composedly  that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn  the court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar  as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever   over the prisoner s head there was a mirror  to throw the light down upon him  crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it  and had passed from its surface and this earth s together  haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been  if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections  as the ocean is one day to give up its dead  some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved  may have struck the prisoner s mind  be that as it may  a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face  he looked up  and when he saw the glass his face flushed  and his right hand pushed the herbs away   it happened  that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left  about on a level with his eyes  there sat  in that corner of the judge s bench  two persons upon whom his look immediately rested  so immediately  and so much to the changing of his aspect  that all the eyes that were turned upon him  turned to them   the spectators saw in the two figures  a young lady of little more than twenty  and a gentleman who was evidently her father  a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair  and a certain indescribable intensity of face  not of an active kind  but pondering and self communing  when this expression was upon him  he looked as if he were old  but when it was stirred and broken up  as it was now  in a moment  on his speaking to his daughter  he became a handsome man  not past the prime of life   his daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm  as she sat by him  and the other pressed upon it  she had drawn close to him  in her dread of the scene  and in her pity for the prisoner  her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused  this had been so very noticeable  so very powerfully and naturally shown  that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her  and the whisper went about   who are they    jerry  the messenger  who had made his own observations  in his own manner  and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption  stretched his neck to hear who they were  the crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant  and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back  at last it got to jerry    witnesses     for which side     against     against what side     the prisoner s    the judge  whose eyes had gone in the general direction  recalled them  leaned back in his seat  and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand  as mr  attorney general rose to spin the rope  grind the axe  and hammer the nails into the scaffold      iii  a disappointment   mr  attorney general had to inform the jury  that the prisoner before them  though young in years  was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life  that this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to day  or of yesterday  or even of last year  or of the year before  that  it was certain the prisoner had  for longer than that  been in the habit of passing and repassing between france and england  on secret business of which he could give no honest account  that  if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive  which happily it never was   the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered  that providence  however  had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach  to ferret out the nature of the prisoner s schemes  and  struck with horror  to disclose them to his majesty s chief secretary of state and most honourable privy council  that  this patriot would be produced before them  that  his position and attitude were  on the whole  sublime  that  he had been the prisoner s friend  but  at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy  had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom  on the sacred altar of his country  that  if statues were decreed in britain  as in ancient greece and rome  to public benefactors  this shining citizen would assuredly have had one  that  as they were not so decreed  he probably would not have one  that  virtue  as had been observed by the poets  in many passages which he well knew the jury would have  word for word  at the tips of their tongues  whereat the jury s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages   was in a manner contagious  more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism  or love of country  that  the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the crown  to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour  had communicated itself to the prisoner s servant  and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his master s table drawers and pockets  and secrete his papers  that  he  mr  attorney general  was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant  but that  in a general way  he preferred him to his  mr  attorney general s  brothers and sisters  and honoured him more than his  mr  attorney general s  father and mother  that  he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise  that  the evidence of these two witnesses  coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced  would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his majesty s forces  and of their disposition and preparation  both by sea and land  and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power  that  these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner s handwriting  but that it was all the same  that  indeed  it was rather the better for the prosecution  as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions  that  the proof would go back five years  and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions  within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the british troops and the americans  that  for these reasons  the jury  being a loyal jury  as he knew they were   and being a responsible jury  as they knew they were   must positively find the prisoner guilty  and make an end of him  whether they liked it or not  that  they never could lay their heads upon their pillows  that  they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows  that  they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows  in short  that there never more could be  for them or theirs  any laying of heads upon pillows at all  unless the prisoner s head was taken off  that head mr  attorney general concluded by demanding of them  in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it  and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone   when the attorney general ceased  a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue flies were swarming about the prisoner  in anticipation of what he was soon to become  when toned down again  the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness box   mr  solicitor general then  following his leader s lead  examined the patriot  john barsad  gentleman  by name  the story of his pure soul was exactly what mr  attorney general had described it to be  perhaps  if it had a fault  a little too exactly  having released his noble bosom of its burden  he would have modestly withdrawn himself  but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him  sitting not far from mr  lorry  begged to ask him a few questions  the wigged gentleman sitting opposite  still looking at the ceiling of the court   had he ever been a spy himself  no  he scorned the base insinuation  what did he live upon  his property  where was his property  he didn t precisely remember where it was  what was it  no business of anybody s  had he inherited it  yes  he had  from whom  distant relation  very distant  rather  ever been in prison  certainly not  never in a debtors  prison  didn t see what that had to do with it  never in a debtors  prison   come  once again  never  yes  how many times  two or three times  not five or six  perhaps  of what profession  gentleman  ever been kicked  might have been  frequently  no  ever kicked downstairs  decidedly not  once received a kick on the top of a staircase  and fell downstairs of his own accord  kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice  something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault  but it was not true  swear it was not true  positively  ever live by cheating at play  never  ever live by play  not more than other gentlemen do  ever borrow money of the prisoner  yes  ever pay him  no  was not this intimacy with the prisoner  in reality a very slight one  forced upon the prisoner in coaches  inns  and packets  no  sure he saw the prisoner with these lists  certain  knew no more about the lists  no  had not procured them himself  for instance  no  expect to get anything by this evidence  no  not in regular government pay and employment  to lay traps  oh dear no  or to do anything  oh dear no  swear that  over and over again  no motives but motives of sheer patriotism  none whatever   the virtuous servant  roger cly  swore his way through the case at a great rate  he had taken service with the prisoner  in good faith and simplicity  four years ago  he had asked the prisoner  aboard the calais packet  if he wanted a handy fellow  and the prisoner had engaged him  he had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity  never thought of such a thing  he began to have suspicions of the prisoner  and to keep an eye upon him  soon afterwards  in arranging his clothes  while travelling  he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner s pockets  over and over again  he had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner s desk  he had not put them there first  he had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to french gentlemen at calais  and similar lists to french gentlemen  both at calais and boulogne  he loved his country  and couldn t bear it  and had given information  he had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea pot  he had been maligned respecting a mustard pot  but it turned out to be only a plated one  he had known the last witness seven or eight years  that was merely a coincidence  he didn t call it a particularly curious coincidence  most coincidences were curious  neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too  he was a true briton  and hoped there were many like him   the blue flies buzzed again  and mr  attorney general called mr  jarvis lorry    mr  jarvis lorry  are you a clerk in tellson s bank     i am     on a certain friday night in november one thousand seven hundred and seventy five  did business occasion you to travel between london and dover by the mail     it did     were there any other passengers in the mail     two     did they alight on the road in the course of the night     they did     mr  lorry  look upon the prisoner  was he one of those two passengers     i cannot undertake to say that he was     does he resemble either of these two passengers     both were so wrapped up  and the night was so dark  and we were all so reserved  that i cannot undertake to say even that     mr  lorry  look again upon the prisoner  supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were  is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them     no     you will not swear  mr  lorry  that he was not one of them     no     so at least you say he may have been one of them     yes  except that i remember them both to have been  like myself  timorous of highwaymen  and the prisoner has not a timorous air     did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity  mr  lorry     i certainly have seen that     mr  lorry  look once more upon the prisoner  have you seen him  to your certain knowledge  before     i have     when     i was returning from france a few days afterwards  and  at calais  the prisoner came on board the packet ship in which i returned  and made the voyage with me     at what hour did he come on board     at a little after midnight     in the dead of the night  was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour     he happened to be the only one     never mind about  happening   mr  lorry  he was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night     he was     were you travelling alone  mr  lorry  or with any companion     with two companions  a gentleman and lady  they are here     they are here  had you any conversation with the prisoner     hardly any  the weather was stormy  and the passage long and rough  and i lay on a sofa  almost from shore to shore     miss manette    the young lady  to whom all eyes had been turned before  and were now turned again  stood up where she had sat  her father rose with her  and kept her hand drawn through his arm    miss manette  look upon the prisoner    to be confronted with such pity  and such earnest youth and beauty  was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd  standing  as it were  apart with her on the edge of his grave  not all the staring curiosity that looked on  could  for the moment  nerve him to remain quite still  his hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden  and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart  the buzz of the great flies was loud again    miss manette  have you seen the prisoner before     yes  sir     where     on board of the packet ship just now referred to  sir  and on the same occasion     you are the young lady just now referred to     o  most unhappily  i am    the plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice of the judge  as he said something fiercely   answer the questions put to you  and make no remark upon them     miss manette  had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the channel     yes  sir     recall it    in the midst of a profound stillness  she faintly began   when the gentleman came on board      do you mean the prisoner   inquired the judge  knitting his brows    yes  my lord     then say the prisoner     when the prisoner came on board  he noticed that my father   turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her   was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health  my father was so reduced that i was afraid to take him out of the air  and i had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps  and i sat on the deck at his side to take care of him  there were no other passengers that night  but we four  the prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how i could shelter my father from the wind and weather  better than i had done  i had not known how to do it well  not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour  he did it for me  he expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father s state  and i am sure he felt it  that was the manner of our beginning to speak together     let me interrupt you for a moment  had he come on board alone     no     how many were with him     two french gentlemen     had they conferred together     they had conferred together until the last moment  when it was necessary for the french gentlemen to be landed in their boat     had any papers been handed about among them  similar to these lists     some papers had been handed about among them  but i don t know what papers     like these in shape and size     possibly  but indeed i don t know  although they stood whispering very near to me  because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there  it was a dull lamp  and they spoke very low  and i did not hear what they said  and saw only that they looked at papers     now  to the prisoner s conversation  miss manette     the prisoner was as open in his confidence with me  which arose out of my helpless situation  as he was kind  and good  and useful to my father  i hope   bursting into tears   i may not repay him by doing him harm to day    buzzing from the blue flies    miss manette  if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to give  which you must give  and which you cannot escape from giving  with great unwillingness  he is the only person present in that condition  please to go on     he told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature  which might get people into trouble  and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name  he said that this business had  within a few days  taken him to france  and might  at intervals  take him backwards and forwards between france and england for a long time to come     did he say anything about america  miss manette  be particular     he tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen  and he said that  so far as he could judge  it was a wrong and foolish one on england s part  he added  in a jesting way  that perhaps george washington might gain almost as great a name in history as george the third  but there was no harm in his way of saying this  it was said laughingly  and to beguile the time    any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed  will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators  her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence  and  in the pauses when she stopped for the judge to write it down  watched its effect upon the counsel for and against  among the lookers on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court  insomuch  that a great majority of the foreheads there  might have been mirrors reflecting the witness  when the judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about george washington   mr  attorney general now signified to my lord  that he deemed it necessary  as a matter of precaution and form  to call the young lady s father  doctor manette  who was called accordingly    doctor manette  look upon the prisoner  have you ever seen him before     once  when he called at my lodgings in london  some three years  or three years and a half ago     can you identify him as your fellow passenger on board the packet  or speak to his conversation with your daughter     sir  i can do neither     is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either    he answered  in a low voice   there is     has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment  without trial  or even accusation  in your native country  doctor manette    he answered  in a tone that went to every heart   a long imprisonment     were you newly released on the occasion in question     they tell me so     have you no remembrance of the occasion     none  my mind is a blank  from some time  i cannot even say what time  when i employed myself  in my captivity  in making shoes  to the time when i found myself living in london with my dear daughter here  she had become familiar to me  when a gracious god restored my faculties  but  i am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar  i have no remembrance of the process    mr  attorney general sat down  and the father and daughter sat down together   a singular circumstance then arose in the case  the object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down  with some fellow plotter untracked  in the dover mail on that friday night in november five years ago  and got out of the mail in the night  as a blind  at a place where he did not remain  but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more  to a garrison and dockyard  and there collected information  a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required  in the coffee room of an hotel in that garrison and dockyard town  waiting for another person  the prisoner s counsel was cross examining this witness with no result  except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion  when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court  wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper  screwed it up  and tossed it to him  opening this piece of paper in the next pause  the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner    you say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner    the witness was quite sure    did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner    not so like  the witness said  as that he could be mistaken    look well upon that gentleman  my learned friend there   pointing to him who had tossed the paper over   and then look well upon the prisoner  how say you  are they very like each other    allowing for my learned friend s appearance being careless and slovenly if not debauched  they were sufficiently like each other to surprise  not only the witness  but everybody present  when they were thus brought into comparison  my lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig  and giving no very gracious consent  the likeness became much more remarkable  my lord inquired of mr  stryver  the prisoner s counsel   whether they were next to try mr  carton  name of my learned friend  for treason  but  mr  stryver replied to my lord  no  but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once  might happen twice  whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner  whether he would be so confident  having seen it  and more  the upshot of which  was  to smash this witness like a crockery vessel  and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber   mr  cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence  he had now to attend while mr  stryver fitted the prisoner s case on the jury  like a compact suit of clothes  showing them how the patriot  barsad  was a hired spy and traitor  an unblushing trafficker in blood  and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed judas  which he certainly did look rather like  how the virtuous servant  cly  was his friend and partner  and was worthy to be  how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim  because some family affairs in france  he being of french extraction  did require his making those passages across the channel  though what those affairs were  a consideration for others who were near and dear to him  forbade him  even for his life  to disclose  how the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady  whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed  came to nothing  involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together   with the exception of that reference to george washington  which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke  how it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears  and therefore mr  attorney general had made the most of it  how  nevertheless  it rested upon nothing  save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases  and of which the state trials of this country were full  but  there my lord interposed  with as grave a face as if it had not been true   saying that he could not sit upon that bench and suffer those allusions   mr  stryver then called his few witnesses  and mr  cruncher had next to attend while mr  attorney general turned the whole suit of clothes mr  stryver had fitted on the jury  inside out  showing how barsad and cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them  and the prisoner a hundred times worse  lastly  came my lord himself  turning the suit of clothes  now inside out  now outside in  but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave clothes for the prisoner   and now  the jury turned to consider  and the great flies swarmed again   mr  carton  who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court  changed neither his place nor his attitude  even in this excitement  while his learned friend  mr  stryver  massing his papers before him  whispered with those who sat near  and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury  while all the spectators moved more or less  and grouped themselves anew  while even my lord himself arose from his seat  and slowly paced up and down his platform  not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish  this one man sat leaning back  with his torn gown half off him  his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal  his hands in his pockets  and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day  something especially reckless in his demeanour  not only gave him a disreputable look  but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner  which his momentary earnestness  when they were compared together  had strengthened   that many of the lookers on  taking note of him now  said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike  mr  cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour  and added   i d hold half a guinea that he don t get no law work to do  don t look like the sort of one to get any  do he    yet  this mr  carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in  for now  when miss manette s head dropped upon her father s breast  he was the first to see it  and to say audibly   officer  look to that young lady  help the gentleman to take her out  don t you see she will fall    there was much commiseration for her as she was removed  and much sympathy with her father  it had evidently been a great distress to him  to have the days of his imprisonment recalled  he had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned  and that pondering or brooding look which made him old  had been upon him  like a heavy cloud  ever since  as he passed out  the jury  who had turned back and paused a moment  spoke  through their foreman   they were not agreed  and wished to retire  my lord  perhaps with george washington on his mind  showed some surprise that they were not agreed  but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward  and retired himself  the trial had lasted all day  and the lamps in the court were now being lighted  it began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while  the spectators dropped off to get refreshment  and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock  and sat down   mr  lorry  who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out  now reappeared  and beckoned to jerry  who  in the slackened interest  could easily get near him    jerry  if you wish to take something to eat  you can  but  keep in the way  you will be sure to hear when the jury come in  don t be a moment behind them  for i want you to take the verdict back to the bank  you are the quickest messenger i know  and will get to temple bar long before i can    jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle  and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling  mr  carton came up at the moment  and touched mr  lorry on the arm    how is the young lady     she is greatly distressed  but her father is comforting her  and she feels the better for being out of court     i ll tell the prisoner so  it won t do for a respectable bank gentleman like you  to be seen speaking to him publicly  you know    mr  lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind  and mr  carton made his way to the outside of the bar  the way out of court lay in that direction  and jerry followed him  all eyes  ears  and spikes    mr  darnay    the prisoner came forward directly    you will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness  miss manette  she will do very well  you have seen the worst of her agitation     i am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it  could you tell her so for me  with my fervent acknowledgments     yes  i could  i will  if you ask it    mr  carton s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent  he stood  half turned from the prisoner  lounging with his elbow against the bar    i do ask it  accept my cordial thanks     what   said carton  still only half turned towards him   do you expect  mr  darnay     the worst     it s the wisest thing to expect  and the likeliest  but i think their withdrawing is in your favour    loitering on the way out of court not being allowed  jerry heard no more  but left them  so like each other in feature  so unlike each other in manner  standing side by side  both reflected in the glass above them   an hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief and rascal crowded passages below  even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale  the hoarse messenger  uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection  had dropped into a doze  when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court  carried him along with them    jerry  jerry   mr  lorry was already calling at the door when he got there    here  sir  it s a fight to get back again  here i am  sir    mr  lorry handed him a paper through the throng   quick  have you got it     yes  sir    hastily written on the paper was the word  acquitted     if you had sent the message   recalled to life   again   muttered jerry  as he turned   i should have known what you meant  this time    he had no opportunity of saying  or so much as thinking  anything else  until he was clear of the old bailey  for  the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs  and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue flies were dispersing in search of other carrion      iv  congratulatory   from the dimly lighted passages of the court  the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day  was straining off  when doctor manette  lucie manette  his daughter  mr  lorry  the solicitor for the defence  and its counsel  mr  stryver  stood gathered round mr  charles darnay  just released  congratulating him on his escape from death   it would have been difficult by a far brighter light  to recognise in doctor manette  intellectual of face and upright of bearing  the shoemaker of the garret in paris  yet  no one could have looked at him twice  without looking again  even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice  and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully  without any apparent reason  while one external cause  and that a reference to his long lingering agony  would always  as on the trial  evoke this condition from the depths of his soul  it was also in its nature to arise of itself  and to draw a gloom over him  as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun  when the substance was three hundred miles away   only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind  she was the golden thread that united him to a past beyond his misery  and to a present beyond his misery  and the sound of her voice  the light of her face  the touch of her hand  had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always  not absolutely always  for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed  but they were few and slight  and she believed them over   mr  darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully  and had turned to mr  stryver  whom he warmly thanked  mr  stryver  a man of little more than thirty  but looking twenty years older than he was  stout  loud  red  bluff  and free from any drawback of delicacy  had a pushing way of shouldering himself  morally and physically  into companies and conversations  that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life   he still had his wig and gown on  and he said  squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent mr  lorry clean out of the group   i am glad to have brought you off with honour  mr  darnay  it was an infamous prosecution  grossly infamous  but not the less likely to succeed on that account     you have laid me under an obligation to you for life  in two senses    said his late client  taking his hand    i have done my best for you  mr  darnay  and my best is as good as another man s  i believe    it clearly being incumbent on some one to say   much better   mr  lorry said it  perhaps not quite disinterestedly  but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again    you think so   said mr  stryver   well  you have been present all day  and you ought to know  you are a man of business  too     and as such   quoth mr  lorry  whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group  just as he had previously shouldered him out of it   as such i will appeal to doctor manette  to break up this conference and order us all to our homes  miss lucie looks ill  mr  darnay has had a terrible day  we are worn out     speak for yourself  mr  lorry   said stryver   i have a night s work to do yet  speak for yourself     i speak for myself   answered mr  lorry   and for mr  darnay  and for miss lucie  and  miss lucie  do you not think i may speak for us all    he asked her the question pointedly  and with a glance at her father   his face had become frozen  as it were  in a very curious look at darnay  an intent look  deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust  not even unmixed with fear  with this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away    my father   said lucie  softly laying her hand on his   he slowly shook the shadow off  and turned to her    shall we go home  my father    with a long breath  he answered  yes    the friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed  under the impression  which he himself had originated  that he would not be released that night  the lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages  the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle  and the dismal place was deserted until to morrow morning s interest of gallows  pillory  whipping post  and branding iron  should repeople it  walking between her father and mr  darnay  lucie manette passed into the open air  a hackney coach was called  and the father and daughter departed in it   mr  stryver had left them in the passages  to shoulder his way back to the robing room  another person  who had not joined the group  or interchanged a word with any one of them  but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest  had silently strolled out after the rest  and had looked on until the coach drove away  he now stepped up to where mr  lorry and mr  darnay stood upon the pavement    so  mr  lorry  men of business may speak to mr  darnay now    nobody had made any acknowledgment of mr  carton s part in the day s proceedings  nobody had known of it  he was unrobed  and was none the better for it in appearance    if you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind  when the business mind is divided between good natured impulse and business appearances  you would be amused  mr  darnay    mr  lorry reddened  and said  warmly   you have mentioned that before  sir  we men of business  who serve a house  are not our own masters  we have to think of the house more than ourselves     i know  i know   rejoined mr  carton  carelessly   don t be nettled  mr  lorry  you are as good as another  i have no doubt  better  i dare say     and indeed  sir   pursued mr  lorry  not minding him   i really don t know what you have to do with the matter  if you ll excuse me  as very much your elder  for saying so  i really don t know that it is your business     business  bless you  i have no business   said mr  carton    it is a pity you have not  sir     i think so  too     if you had   pursued mr  lorry   perhaps you would attend to it     lord love you  no   i shouldn t   said mr  carton    well  sir   cried mr  lorry  thoroughly heated by his indifference   business is a very good thing  and a very respectable thing  and  sir  if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments  mr  darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance  mr  darnay  good night  god bless you  sir  i hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life   chair there    perhaps a little angry with himself  as well as with the barrister  mr  lorry bustled into the chair  and was carried off to tellson s  carton  who smelt of port wine  and did not appear to be quite sober  laughed then  and turned to darnay    this is a strange chance that throws you and me together  this must be a strange night to you  standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones     i hardly seem yet   returned charles darnay   to belong to this world again     i don t wonder at it  it s not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another  you speak faintly     i begin to think i am faint     then why the devil don t you dine  i dined  myself  while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to  this  or some other  let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at    drawing his arm through his own  he took him down ludgate hill to fleet street  and so  up a covered way  into a tavern  here  they were shown into a little room  where charles darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine  while carton sat opposite to him at the same table  with his separate bottle of port before him  and his fully half insolent manner upon him    do you feel  yet  that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again  mr  darnay     i am frightfully confused regarding time and place  but i am so far mended as to feel that     it must be an immense satisfaction    he said it bitterly  and filled up his glass again  which was a large one    as to me  the greatest desire i have  is to forget that i belong to it  it has no good in it for me  except wine like this  nor i for it  so we are not much alike in that particular  indeed  i begin to think we are not much alike in any particular  you and i    confused by the emotion of the day  and feeling his being there with this double of coarse deportment  to be like a dream  charles darnay was at a loss how to answer  finally  answered not at all    now your dinner is done   carton presently said   why don t you call a health  mr  darnay  why don t you give your toast     what health  what toast     why  it s on the tip of your tongue  it ought to be  it must be  i ll swear it s there     miss manette  then     miss manette  then    looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast  carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall  where it shivered to pieces  then  rang the bell  and ordered in another    that s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark  mr  darnay    he said  filling his new goblet   a slight frown and a laconic  yes   were the answer    that s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by  how does it feel  is it worth being tried for one s life  to be the object of such sympathy and compassion  mr  darnay    again darnay answered not a word    she was mightily pleased to have your message  when i gave it her  not that she showed she was pleased  but i suppose she was    the allusion served as a timely reminder to darnay that this disagreeable companion had  of his own free will  assisted him in the strait of the day  he turned the dialogue to that point  and thanked him for it    i neither want any thanks  nor merit any   was the careless rejoinder   it was nothing to do  in the first place  and i don t know why i did it  in the second  mr  darnay  let me ask you a question     willingly  and a small return for your good offices     do you think i particularly like you     really  mr  carton   returned the other  oddly disconcerted   i have not asked myself the question     but ask yourself the question now     you have acted as if you do  but i don t think you do     i don t think i do   said carton   i begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding     nevertheless   pursued darnay  rising to ring the bell   there is nothing in that  i hope  to prevent my calling the reckoning  and our parting without ill blood on either side    carton rejoining   nothing in life   darnay rang   do you call the whole reckoning   said carton  on his answering in the affirmative   then bring me another pint of this same wine  drawer  and come and wake me at ten    the bill being paid  charles darnay rose and wished him good night  without returning the wish  carton rose too  with something of a threat of defiance in his manner  and said   a last word  mr  darnay  you think i am drunk     i think you have been drinking  mr  carton     think  you know i have been drinking     since i must say so  i know it     then you shall likewise know why  i am a disappointed drudge  sir  i care for no man on earth  and no man on earth cares for me     much to be regretted  you might have used your talents better     may be so  mr  darnay  may be not  don t let your sober face elate you  however  you don t know what it may come to  good night    when he was left alone  this strange being took up a candle  went to a glass that hung against the wall  and surveyed himself minutely in it    do you particularly like the man   he muttered  at his own image   why should you particularly like a man who resembles you  there is nothing in you to like  you know that  ah  confound you  what a change you have made in yourself  a good reason for taking to a man  that he shows you what you have fallen away from  and what you might have been  change places with him  and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was  and commiserated by that agitated face as he was  come on  and have it out in plain words  you hate the fellow    he resorted to his pint of wine for consolation  drank it all in a few minutes  and fell asleep on his arms  with his hair straggling over the table  and a long winding sheet in the candle dripping down upon him      v  the jackal   those were drinking days  and most men drank hard  so very great is the improvement time has brought about in such habits  that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night  without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman  would seem  in these days  a ridiculous exaggeration  the learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its bacchanalian propensities  neither was mr  stryver  already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice  behind his compeers in this particular  any more than in the drier parts of the legal race   a favourite at the old bailey  and eke at the sessions  mr  stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted  sessions and old bailey had now to summon their favourite  specially  to their longing arms  and shouldering itself towards the visage of the lord chief justice in the court of king s bench  the florid countenance of mr  stryver might be daily seen  bursting out of the bed of wigs  like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden full of flaring companions   it had once been noted at the bar  that while mr  stryver was a glib man  and an unscrupulous  and a ready  and a bold  he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements  which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate s accomplishments  but  a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this  the more business he got  the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow  and however late at night he sat carousing with sydney carton  he always had his points at his fingers  ends in the morning   sydney carton  idlest and most unpromising of men  was stryver s great ally  what the two drank together  between hilary term and michaelmas  might have floated a king s ship  stryver never had a case in hand  anywhere  but carton was there  with his hands in his pockets  staring at the ceiling of the court  they went the same circuit  and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night  and carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day  going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings  like a dissipated cat  at last  it began to get about  among such as were interested in the matter  that although sydney carton would never be a lion  he was an amazingly good jackal  and that he rendered suit and service to stryver in that humble capacity    ten o clock  sir   said the man at the tavern  whom he had charged to wake him   ten o clock  sir     what s the matter     ten o clock  sir     what do you mean  ten o clock at night     yes  sir  your honour told me to call you     oh  i remember  very well  very well    after a few dull efforts to get to sleep again  which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes  he got up  tossed his hat on  and walked out  he turned into the temple  and  having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of king s bench walk and paper buildings  turned into the stryver chambers   the stryver clerk  who never assisted at these conferences  had gone home  and the stryver principal opened the door  he had his slippers on  and a loose bed gown  and his throat was bare for his greater ease  he had that rather wild  strained  seared marking about the eyes  which may be observed in all free livers of his class  from the portrait of jeffries downward  and which can be traced  under various disguises of art  through the portraits of every drinking age    you are a little late  memory   said stryver    about the usual time  it may be a quarter of an hour later    they went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers  where there was a blazing fire  a kettle steamed upon the hob  and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone  with plenty of wine upon it  and brandy  and rum  and sugar  and lemons    you have had your bottle  i perceive  sydney     two to night  i think  i have been dining with the day s client  or seeing him dine  it s all one     that was a rare point  sydney  that you brought to bear upon the identification  how did you come by it  when did it strike you     i thought he was rather a handsome fellow  and i thought i should have been much the same sort of fellow  if i had had any luck    mr  stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch    you and your luck  sydney  get to work  get to work    sullenly enough  the jackal loosened his dress  went into an adjoining room  and came back with a large jug of cold water  a basin  and a towel or two  steeping the towels in the water  and partially wringing them out  he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold  sat down at the table  and said   now i am ready     not much boiling down to be done to night  memory   said mr  stryver  gaily  as he looked among his papers    how much     only two sets of them     give me the worst first     there they are  sydney  fire away    the lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinking table  while the jackal sat at his own paper bestrewn table proper  on the other side of it  with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand  both resorted to the drinking table without stint  but each in a different way  the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband  looking at the fire  or occasionally flirting with some lighter document  the jackal  with knitted brows and intent face  so deep in his task  that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass  which often groped about  for a minute or more  before it found the glass for his lips  two or three times  the matter in hand became so knotty  that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up  and steep his towels anew  from these pilgrimages to the jug and basin  he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe  which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity   at length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion  and proceeded to offer it to him  the lion took it with care and caution  made his selections from it  and his remarks upon it  and the jackal assisted both  when the repast was fully discussed  the lion put his hands in his waistband again  and lay down to meditate  the jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle  and a fresh application to his head  and applied himself to the collection of a second meal  this was administered to the lion in the same manner  and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning    and now we have done  sydney  fill a bumper of punch   said mr  stryver   the jackal removed the towels from his head  which had been steaming again  shook himself  yawned  shivered  and complied    you were very sound  sydney  in the matter of those crown witnesses to day  every question told     i always am sound  am i not     i don t gainsay it  what has roughened your temper  put some punch to it and smooth it again    with a deprecatory grunt  the jackal again complied    the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school   said stryver  nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past   the old seesaw sydney  up one minute and down the next  now in spirits and now in despondency     ah   returned the other  sighing   yes  the same sydney  with the same luck  even then  i did exercises for other boys  and seldom did my own     and why not     god knows  it was my way  i suppose    he sat  with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him  looking at the fire    carton   said his friend  squaring himself at him with a bullying air  as if the fire grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged  and the one delicate thing to be done for the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school was to shoulder him into it   your way is  and always was  a lame way  you summon no energy and purpose  look at me     oh  botheration   returned sydney  with a lighter and more good humoured laugh   don t you be moral     how have i done what i have done   said stryver   how do i do what i do     partly through paying me to help you  i suppose  but it s not worth your while to apostrophise me  or the air  about it  what you want to do  you do  you were always in the front rank  and i was always behind     i had to get into the front rank  i was not born there  was i     i was not present at the ceremony  but my opinion is you were   said carton  at this  he laughed again  and they both laughed    before shrewsbury  and at shrewsbury  and ever since shrewsbury    pursued carton   you have fallen into your rank  and i have fallen into mine  even when we were fellow students in the student quarter of paris  picking up french  and french law  and other french crumbs that we didn t get much good of  you were always somewhere  and i was always nowhere     and whose fault was that     upon my soul  i am not sure that it was not yours  you were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing  to that restless degree that i had no chance for my life but in rust and repose  it s a gloomy thing  however  to talk about one s own past  with the day breaking  turn me in some other direction before i go     well then  pledge me to the pretty witness   said stryver  holding up his glass   are you turned in a pleasant direction    apparently not  for he became gloomy again    pretty witness   he muttered  looking down into his glass   i have had enough of witnesses to day and to night  who s your pretty witness     the picturesque doctor s daughter  miss manette     she pretty     is she not     no     why  man alive  she was the admiration of the whole court     rot the admiration of the whole court  who made the old bailey a judge of beauty  she was a golden haired doll     do you know  sydney   said mr  stryver  looking at him with sharp eyes  and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face   do you know  i rather thought  at the time  that you sympathised with the golden haired doll  and were quick to see what happened to the golden haired doll     quick to see what happened  if a girl  doll or no doll  swoons within a yard or two of a man s nose  he can see it without a perspective glass  i pledge you  but i deny the beauty  and now i ll have no more drink  i ll get to bed    when his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle  to light him down the stairs  the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows  when he got out of the house  the air was cold and sad  the dull sky overcast  the river dark and dim  the whole scene like a lifeless desert  and wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast  as if the desert sand had risen far away  and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city   waste forces within him  and a desert all around  this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace  and saw for a moment  lying in the wilderness before him  a mirage of honourable ambition  self denial  and perseverance  in the fair city of this vision  there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him  gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening  waters of hope that sparkled in his sight  a moment  and it was gone  climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses  he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed  and its pillow was wet with wasted tears   sadly  sadly  the sun rose  it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions  incapable of their directed exercise  incapable of his own help and his own happiness  sensible of the blight on him  and resigning himself to let it eat him away      vi  hundreds of people   the quiet lodgings of doctor manette were in a quiet street corner not far from soho square  on the afternoon of a certain fine sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason  and carried it  as to the public interest and memory  far out to sea  mr  jarvis lorry walked along the sunny streets from clerkenwell where he lived  on his way to dine with the doctor  after several relapses into business absorption  mr  lorry had become the doctor s friend  and the quiet street corner was the sunny part of his life   on this certain fine sunday  mr  lorry walked towards soho  early in the afternoon  for three reasons of habit  firstly  because  on fine sundays  he often walked out  before dinner  with the doctor and lucie  secondly  because  on unfavourable sundays  he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend  talking  reading  looking out of window  and generally getting through the day  thirdly  because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve  and knew how the ways of the doctor s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them   a quainter corner than the corner where the doctor lived  was not to be found in london  there was no way through it  and the front windows of the doctor s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it  there were few buildings then  north of the oxford road  and forest trees flourished  and wild flowers grew  and the hawthorn blossomed  in the now vanished fields  as a consequence  country airs circulated in soho with vigorous freedom  instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement  and there was many a good south wall  not far off  on which the peaches ripened in their season   the summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day  but  when the streets grew hot  the corner was in shadow  though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness  it was a cool spot  staid but cheerful  a wonderful place for echoes  and a very harbour from the raging streets   there ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage  and there was  the doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house  where several callings purported to be pursued by day  but whereof little was audible any day  and which was shunned by all of them at night  in a building at the back  attainable by a courtyard where a plane tree rustled its green leaves  church organs claimed to be made  and silver to be chased  and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall  as if he had beaten himself precious  and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors  very little of these trades  or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up stairs  or of a dim coach trimming maker asserted to have a counting house below  was ever heard or seen  occasionally  a stray workman putting his coat on  traversed the hall  or a stranger peered about there  or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard  or a thump from the golden giant  these  however  were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane tree behind the house  and the echoes in the corner before it  had their own way from sunday morning unto saturday night   doctor manette received such patients here as his old reputation  and its revival in the floating whispers of his story  brought him  his scientific knowledge  and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments  brought him otherwise into moderate request  and he earned as much as he wanted   these things were within mr  jarvis lorry s knowledge  thoughts  and notice  when he rang the door bell of the tranquil house in the corner  on the fine sunday afternoon    doctor manette at home    expected home    miss lucie at home    expected home    miss pross at home    possibly at home  but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of miss pross  as to admission or denial of the fact    as i am at home myself   said mr  lorry   i ll go upstairs    although the doctor s daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth  she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means  which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics  simple as the furniture was  it was set off by so many little adornments  of no value but for their taste and fancy  that its effect was delightful  the disposition of everything in the rooms  from the largest object to the least  the arrangement of colours  the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles  by delicate hands  clear eyes  and good sense  were at once so pleasant in themselves  and so expressive of their originator  that  as mr  lorry stood looking about him  the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him  with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time  whether he approved   there were three rooms on a floor  and  the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all  mr  lorry  smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him  walked from one to another  the first was the best room  and in it were lucie s birds  and flowers  and books  and desk  and work table  and box of water colours  the second was the doctor s consulting room  used also as the dining room  the third  changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane tree in the yard  was the doctor s bedroom  and there  in a corner  stood the disused shoemaker s bench and tray of tools  much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wine shop  in the suburb of saint antoine in paris    i wonder   said mr  lorry  pausing in his looking about   that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him     and why wonder at that   was the abrupt inquiry that made him start   it proceeded from miss pross  the wild red woman  strong of hand  whose acquaintance he had first made at the royal george hotel at dover  and had since improved    i should have thought    mr  lorry began    pooh  you d have thought   said miss pross  and mr  lorry left off    how do you do   inquired that lady then  sharply  and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice    i am pretty well  i thank you   answered mr  lorry  with meekness   how are you     nothing to boast of   said miss pross    indeed     ah  indeed   said miss pross   i am very much put out about my ladybird     indeed     for gracious sake say something else besides  indeed   or you ll fidget me to death   said miss pross  whose character  dissociated from stature  was shortness    really  then   said mr  lorry  as an amendment    really  is bad enough   returned miss pross   but better  yes  i am very much put out     may i ask the cause     i don t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of ladybird  to come here looking after her   said miss pross    do dozens come for that purpose     hundreds   said miss pross   it was characteristic of this lady  as of some other people before her time and since  that whenever her original proposition was questioned  she exaggerated it    dear me   said mr  lorry  as the safest remark he could think of    i have lived with the darling  or the darling has lived with me  and paid me for it  which she certainly should never have done  you may take your affidavit  if i could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothing  since she was ten years old  and it s really very hard    said miss pross   not seeing with precision what was very hard  mr  lorry shook his head  using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything    all sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet  are always turning up   said miss pross   when you began it      i began it  miss pross     didn t you  who brought her father to life     oh  if that was beginning it    said mr  lorry    it wasn t ending it  i suppose  i say  when you began it  it was hard enough  not that i have any fault to find with doctor manette  except that he is not worthy of such a daughter  which is no imputation on him  for it was not to be expected that anybody should be  under any circumstances  but it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him  i could have forgiven him   to take ladybird s affections away from me    mr  lorry knew miss pross to be very jealous  but he also knew her by this time to be  beneath the service of her eccentricity  one of those unselfish creatures  found only among women  who will  for pure love and admiration  bind themselves willing slaves  to youth when they have lost it  to beauty that they never had  to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain  to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives  he knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart  so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint  he had such an exalted respect for it  that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind  we all make such arrangements  more or less  he stationed miss pross much nearer to the lower angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by nature and art  who had balances at tellson s    there never was  nor will be  but one man worthy of ladybird   said miss pross   and that was my brother solomon  if he hadn t made a mistake in life    here again  mr  lorry s inquiries into miss pross s personal history had established the fact that her brother solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed  as a stake to speculate with  and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore  with no touch of compunction  miss pross s fidelity of belief in solomon  deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake  was quite a serious matter with mr  lorry  and had its weight in his good opinion of her    as we happen to be alone for the moment  and are both people of business   he said  when they had got back to the drawing room and had sat down there in friendly relations   let me ask you  does the doctor  in talking with lucie  never refer to the shoemaking time  yet     never     and yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him     ah   returned miss pross  shaking her head   but i don t say he don t refer to it within himself     do you believe that he thinks of it much     i do   said miss pross    do you imagine    mr  lorry had begun  when miss pross took him up short with    never imagine anything  have no imagination at all     i stand corrected  do you suppose  you go so far as to suppose  sometimes     now and then   said miss pross    do you suppose   mr  lorry went on  with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye  as it looked kindly at her   that doctor manette has any theory of his own  preserved through all those years  relative to the cause of his being so oppressed  perhaps  even to the name of his oppressor     i don t suppose anything about it but what ladybird tells me     and that is       that she thinks he has     now don t be angry at my asking all these questions  because i am a mere dull man of business  and you are a woman of business     dull   miss pross inquired  with placidity   rather wishing his modest adjective away  mr  lorry replied   no  no  no  surely not  to return to business   is it not remarkable that doctor manette  unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is  should never touch upon that question  i will not say with me  though he had business relations with me many years ago  and we are now intimate  i will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached  and who is so devotedly attached to him  believe me  miss pross  i don t approach the topic with you  out of curiosity  but out of zealous interest     well  to the best of my understanding  and bad s the best  you ll tell me   said miss pross  softened by the tone of the apology   he is afraid of the whole subject     afraid     it s plain enough  i should think  why he may be  it s a dreadful remembrance  besides that  his loss of himself grew out of it  not knowing how he lost himself  or how he recovered himself  he may never feel certain of not losing himself again  that alone wouldn t make the subject pleasant  i should think    it was a profounder remark than mr  lorry had looked for   true   said he   and fearful to reflect upon  yet  a doubt lurks in my mind  miss pross  whether it is good for doctor manette to have that suppression always shut up within him  indeed  it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence     can t be helped   said miss pross  shaking her head   touch that string  and he instantly changes for the worse  better leave it alone  in short  must leave it alone  like or no like  sometimes  he gets up in the dead of the night  and will be heard  by us overhead there  walking up and down  walking up and down  in his room  ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down  walking up and down  in his old prison  she hurries to him  and they go on together  walking up and down  walking up and down  until he is composed  but he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness  to her  and she finds it best not to hint at it to him  in silence they go walking up and down together  walking up and down together  till her love and company have brought him to himself    notwithstanding miss pross s denial of her own imagination  there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea  in her repetition of the phrase  walking up and down  which testified to her possessing such a thing   the corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes  it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet  that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going    here they are   said miss pross  rising to break up the conference   and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon    it was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties  such a peculiar ear of a place  that as mr  lorry stood at the open window  looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard  he fancied they would never approach  not only would the echoes die away  as though the steps had gone  but  echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead  and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand  however  father and daughter did at last appear  and miss pross was ready at the street door to receive them   miss pross was a pleasant sight  albeit wild  and red  and grim  taking off her darling s bonnet when she came up stairs  and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief  and blowing the dust off it  and folding her mantle ready for laying by  and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women  her darling was a pleasant sight too  embracing her and thanking her  and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her  which last she only dared to do playfully  or miss pross  sorely hurt  would have retired to her own chamber and cried  the doctor was a pleasant sight too  looking on at them  and telling miss pross how she spoilt lucie  in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had  and would have had more if it were possible  mr  lorry was a pleasant sight too  beaming at all this in his little wig  and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home  but  no hundreds of people came to see the sights  and mr  lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of miss pross s prediction   dinner time  and still no hundreds of people  in the arrangements of the little household  miss pross took charge of the lower regions  and always acquitted herself marvellously  her dinners  of a very modest quality  were so well cooked and so well served  and so neat in their contrivances  half english and half french  that nothing could be better  miss pross s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind  she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces  in search of impoverished french  who  tempted by shillings and half crowns  would impart culinary mysteries to her  from these decayed sons and daughters of gaul  she had acquired such wonderful arts  that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress  or cinderella s godmother  who would send out for a fowl  a rabbit  a vegetable or two from the garden  and change them into anything she pleased   on sundays  miss pross dined at the doctor s table  but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods  either in the lower regions  or in her own room on the second floor  a blue chamber  to which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance  on this occasion  miss pross  responding to ladybird s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her  unbent exceedingly  so the dinner was very pleasant  too   it was an oppressive day  and  after dinner  lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane tree  and they should sit there in the air  as everything turned upon her  and revolved about her  they went out under the plane tree  and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of mr  lorry  she had installed herself  some time before  as mr  lorry s cup bearer  and while they sat under the plane tree  talking  she kept his glass replenished  mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked  and the plane tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads   still  the hundreds of people did not present themselves  mr  darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane tree  but he was only one   doctor manette received him kindly  and so did lucie  but  miss pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body  and retired into the house  she was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder  and she called it  in familiar conversation   a fit of the jerks    the doctor was in his best condition  and looked specially young  the resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times  and as they sat side by side  she leaning on his shoulder  and he resting his arm on the back of her chair  it was very agreeable to trace the likeness   he had been talking all day  on many subjects  and with unusual vivacity   pray  doctor manette   said mr  darnay  as they sat under the plane tree  and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand  which happened to be the old buildings of london   have you seen much of the tower     lucie and i have been there  but only casually  we have seen enough of it  to know that it teems with interest  little more     i have been there  as you remember   said darnay  with a smile  though reddening a little angrily   in another character  and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it  they told me a curious thing when i was there     what was that   lucie asked    in making some alterations  the workmen came upon an old dungeon  which had been  for many years  built up and forgotten  every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners  dates  names  complaints  and prayers  upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall  one prisoner  who seemed to have gone to execution  had cut as his last work  three letters  they were done with some very poor instrument  and hurriedly  with an unsteady hand  at first  they were read as d  i  c   but  on being more carefully examined  the last letter was found to be g  there was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials  and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been  at length  it was suggested that the letters were not initials  but the complete word  dig  the floor was examined very carefully under the inscription  and  in the earth beneath a stone  or tile  or some fragment of paving  were found the ashes of a paper  mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag  what the unknown prisoner had written will never be read  but he had written something  and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler     my father   exclaimed lucie   you are ill    he had suddenly started up  with his hand to his head  his manner and his look quite terrified them all    no  my dear  not ill  there are large drops of rain falling  and they made me start  we had better go in    he recovered himself almost instantly  rain was really falling in large drops  and he showed the back of his hand with rain drops on it  but  he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of  and  as they went into the house  the business eye of mr  lorry either detected  or fancied it detected  on his face  as it turned towards charles darnay  the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house   he recovered himself so quickly  however  that mr  lorry had doubts of his business eye  the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was  when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises  if he ever would be   and that the rain had startled him   tea time  and miss pross making tea  with another fit of the jerks upon her  and yet no hundreds of people  mr  carton had lounged in  but he made only two   the night was so very sultry  that although they sat with doors and windows open  they were overpowered by heat  when the tea table was done with  they all moved to one of the windows  and looked out into the heavy twilight  lucie sat by her father  darnay sat beside her  carton leaned against a window  the curtains were long and white  and some of the thunder gusts that whirled into the corner  caught them up to the ceiling  and waved them like spectral wings    the rain drops are still falling  large  heavy  and few   said doctor manette   it comes slowly     it comes surely   said carton   they spoke low  as people watching and waiting mostly do  as people in a dark room  watching and waiting for lightning  always do   there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke  the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going  yet not a footstep was there    a multitude of people  and yet a solitude   said darnay  when they had listened for a while    is it not impressive  mr  darnay   asked lucie   sometimes  i have sat here of an evening  until i have fancied  but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to night  when all is so black and solemn      let us shudder too  we may know what it is     it will seem nothing to you  such whims are only impressive as we originate them  i think  they are not to be communicated  i have sometimes sat alone here of an evening  listening  until i have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by and bye into our lives     there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives  if that be so    sydney carton struck in  in his moody way   the footsteps were incessant  and the hurry of them became more and more rapid  the corner echoed and re echoed with the tread of feet  some  as it seemed  under the windows  some  as it seemed  in the room  some coming  some going  some breaking off  some stopping altogether  all in the distant streets  and not one within sight    are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us  miss manette  or are we to divide them among us     i don t know  mr  darnay  i told you it was a foolish fancy  but you asked for it  when i have yielded myself to it  i have been alone  and then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life  and my father s     i take them into mine   said carton   i ask no questions and make no stipulations  there is a great crowd bearing down upon us  miss manette  and i see them  by the lightning   he added the last words  after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window    and i hear them   he added again  after a peal of thunder   here they come  fast  fierce  and furious    it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified  and it stopped him  for no voice could be heard in it  a memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water  and there was not a moment s interval in crash  and fire  and rain  until after the moon rose at midnight   the great bell of saint paul s was striking one in the cleared air  when mr  lorry  escorted by jerry  high booted and bearing a lantern  set forth on his return passage to clerkenwell  there were solitary patches of road on the way between soho and clerkenwell  and mr  lorry  mindful of foot pads  always retained jerry for this service  though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier    what a night it has been  almost a night  jerry   said mr  lorry   to bring the dead out of their graves     i never see the night myself  master  nor yet i don t expect to  what would do that   answered jerry    good night  mr  carton   said the man of business   good night  mr  darnay  shall we ever see such a night again  together    perhaps  perhaps  see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar  bearing down upon them  too      vii  monseigneur in town   monseigneur  one of the great lords in power at the court  held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in paris  monseigneur was in his inner room  his sanctuary of sanctuaries  the holiest of holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without  monseigneur was about to take his chocolate  monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease  and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing france  but  his morning s chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of monseigneur  without the aid of four strong men besides the cook   yes  it took four men  all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration  and the chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket  emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur  to conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneur s lips  one lacquey carried the chocolate pot into the sacred presence  a second  milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function  a third  presented the favoured napkin  a fourth  he of the two gold watches   poured the chocolate out  it was impossible for monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring heavens  deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men  he must have died of two   monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night  where the comedy and the grand opera were charmingly represented  monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights  with fascinating company  so polite and so impressible was monseigneur  that the comedy and the grand opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets  than the needs of all france  a happy circumstance for france  as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured   always was for england  by way of example   in the regretted days of the merry stuart who sold it   monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business  which was  to let everything go on in its own way  of particular public business  monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way  tend to his own power and pocket  of his pleasures  general and particular  monseigneur had the other truly noble idea  that the world was made for them  the text of his order  altered from the original by only a pronoun  which is not much  ran   the earth and the fulness thereof are mine  saith monseigneur    yet  monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs  both private and public  and he had  as to both classes of affairs  allied himself perforce with a farmer general  as to finances public  because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them  and must consequently let them out to somebody who could  as to finances private  because farmer generals were rich  and monseigneur  after generations of great luxury and expense  was growing poor  hence monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent  while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil  the cheapest garment she could wear  and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmer general  poor in family  which farmer general  carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it  was now among the company in the outer rooms  much prostrated before by mankind  always excepting superior mankind of the blood of monseigneur  who  his own wife included  looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt   a sumptuous man was the farmer general  thirty horses stood in his stables  twenty four male domestics sat in his halls  six body women waited on his wife  as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could  the farmer general  howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality  was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of monseigneur that day   for  the rooms  though a beautiful scene to look at  and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve  were  in truth  not a sound business  considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere  and not so far off  either  but that the watching towers of notre dame  almost equidistant from the two extremes  could see them both   they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business  if that could have been anybody s business  at the house of monseigneur  military officers destitute of military knowledge  naval officers with no idea of a ship  civil officers without a notion of affairs  brazen ecclesiastics  of the worst world worldly  with sensual eyes  loose tongues  and looser lives  all totally unfit for their several callings  all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them  but all nearly or remotely of the order of monseigneur  and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got  these were to be told off by the score and the score  people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state  yet equally unconnected with anything that was real  or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end  were no less abundant  doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed  smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante chambers of monseigneur  projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the state was touched  except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin  poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of  at the reception of monseigneur  unbelieving philosophers who were remodelling the world with words  and making card towers of babel to scale the skies with  talked with unbelieving chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals  at this wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur  exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding  which was at that remarkable time  and has been since  to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest  were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion  at the hotel of monseigneur  such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris  that the spies among the assembled devotees of monseigneur  forming a goodly half of the polite company  would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife  who  in her manners and appearance  owned to being a mother  indeed  except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world  which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother  there was no such thing known to the fashion  peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close  and brought them up  and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty   the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon monseigneur  in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had  for a few years  some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong  as a promising way of setting them right  half of the half dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of convulsionists  and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam  rage  roar  and turn cataleptic on the spot  thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger post to the future  for monseigneur s guidance  besides these dervishes  were other three who had rushed into another sect  which mended matters with a jargon about  the centre of truth   holding that man had got out of the centre of truth  which did not need much demonstration  but had not got out of the circumference  and that he was to be kept from flying out of the circumference  and was even to be shoved back into the centre  by fasting and seeing of spirits  among these  accordingly  much discoursing with spirits went on  and it did a world of good which never became manifest   but  the comfort was  that all the company at the grand hotel of monseigneur were perfectly dressed  if the day of judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day  everybody there would have been eternally correct  such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair  such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended  such gallant swords to look at  and such delicate honour to the sense of smell  would surely keep anything going  for ever and ever  the exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved  these golden fetters rang like precious little bells  and what with that ringing  and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen  there was a flutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and his devouring hunger far away   dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places  everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that was never to leave off  from the palace of the tuileries  through monseigneur and the whole court  through the chambers  the tribunals of justice  and all society  except the scarecrows   the fancy ball descended to the common executioner  who  in pursuance of the charm  was required to officiate  frizzled  powdered  in a gold laced coat  pumps  and white silk stockings   at the gallows and the wheel  the axe was a rarity  monsieur paris  as it was the episcopal mode among his brother professors of the provinces  monsieur orleans  and the rest  to call him  presided in this dainty dress  and who among the company at monseigneur s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our lord  could possibly doubt  that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman  powdered  gold laced  pumped  and white silk stockinged  would see the very stars out   monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate  caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrown open  and issued forth  then  what submission  what cringing and fawning  what servility  what abject humiliation  as to bowing down in body and spirit  nothing in that way was left for heaven  which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never troubled it   bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there  a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another  monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of truth  there  monseigneur turned  and came back again  and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites  and was seen no more   the show being over  the flutter in the air became quite a little storm  and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs  there was soon but one person left of all the crowd  and he  with his hat under his arm and his snuff box in his hand  slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out    i devote you   said this person  stopping at the last door on his way  and turning in the direction of the sanctuary   to the devil    with that  he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet  and quietly walked downstairs   he was a man of about sixty  handsomely dressed  haughty in manner  and with a face like a fine mask  a face of a transparent paleness  every feature in it clearly defined  one set expression on it  the nose  beautifully formed otherwise  was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril  in those two compressions  or dints  the only little change that the face ever showed  resided  they persisted in changing colour sometimes  and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation  then  they gave a look of treachery  and cruelty  to the whole countenance  examined with attention  its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth  and the lines of the orbits of the eyes  being much too horizontal and thin  still  in the effect of the face made  it was a handsome face  and a remarkable one   its owner went downstairs into the courtyard  got into his carriage  and drove away  not many people had talked with him at the reception  he had stood in a little space apart  and monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner  it appeared  under the circumstances  rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses  and often barely escaping from being run down  his man drove as if he were charging an enemy  and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face  or to the lips  of the master  the complaint had sometimes made itself audible  even in that deaf city and dumb age  that  in the narrow streets without footways  the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner  but  few cared enough for that to think of it a second time  and  in this matter  as in all others  the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could   with a wild rattle and clatter  and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days  the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners  with women screaming before it  and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way  at last  swooping at a street corner by a fountain  one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt  and there was a loud cry from a number of voices  and the horses reared and plunged   but for the latter inconvenience  the carriage probably would not have stopped  carriages were often known to drive on  and leave their wounded behind  and why not  but the frightened valet had got down in a hurry  and there were twenty hands at the horses  bridles    what has gone wrong   said monsieur  calmly looking out   a tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses  and had laid it on the basement of the fountain  and was down in the mud and wet  howling over it like a wild animal    pardon  monsieur the marquis   said a ragged and submissive man   it is a child     why does he make that abominable noise  is it his child     excuse me  monsieur the marquis  it is a pity  yes    the fountain was a little removed  for the street opened  where it was  into a space some ten or twelve yards square  as the tall man suddenly got up from the ground  and came running at the carriage  monsieur the marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword hilt    killed   shrieked the man  in wild desperation  extending both arms at their length above his head  and staring at him   dead    the people closed round  and looked at monsieur the marquis  there was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness  there was no visible menacing or anger  neither did the people say anything  after the first cry  they had been silent  and they remained so  the voice of the submissive man who had spoken  was flat and tame in its extreme submission  monsieur the marquis ran his eyes over them all  as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes   he took out his purse    it is extraordinary to me   said he   that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children  one or the other of you is for ever in the way  how do i know what injury you have done my horses  see  give him that    he threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up  and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell  the tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry   dead    he was arrested by the quick arrival of another man  for whom the rest made way  on seeing him  the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder  sobbing and crying  and pointing to the fountain  where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle  and moving gently about it  they were as silent  however  as the men    i know all  i know all   said the last comer   be a brave man  my gaspard  it is better for the poor little plaything to die so  than to live  it has died in a moment without pain  could it have lived an hour as happily     you are a philosopher  you there   said the marquis  smiling   how do they call you     they call me defarge     of what trade     monsieur the marquis  vendor of wine     pick up that  philosopher and vendor of wine   said the marquis  throwing him another gold coin   and spend it as you will  the horses there  are they right    without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time  monsieur the marquis leaned back in his seat  and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing  and had paid for it  and could afford to pay for it  when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage  and ringing on its floor    hold   said monsieur the marquis   hold the horses  who threw that    he looked to the spot where defarge the vendor of wine had stood  a moment before  but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot  and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman  knitting    you dogs   said the marquis  but smoothly  and with an unchanged front  except as to the spots on his nose   i would ride over any of you very willingly  and exterminate you from the earth  if i knew which rascal threw at the carriage  and if that brigand were sufficiently near it  he should be crushed under the wheels    so cowed was their condition  and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them  within the law and beyond it  that not a voice  or a hand  or even an eye was raised  among the men  not one  but the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily  and looked the marquis in the face  it was not for his dignity to notice it  his contemptuous eyes passed over her  and over all the other rats  and he leaned back in his seat again  and gave the word  go on    he was driven on  and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession  the minister  the state projector  the farmer general  the doctor  the lawyer  the ecclesiastic  the grand opera  the comedy  the whole fancy ball in a bright continuous flow  came whirling by  the rats had crept out of their holes to look on  and they remained looking on for hours  soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle  and making a barrier behind which they slunk  and through which they peeped  the father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it  when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain  sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the fancy ball  when the one woman who had stood conspicuous  knitting  still knitted on with the steadfastness of fate  the water of the fountain ran  the swift river ran  the day ran into evening  so much life in the city ran into death according to rule  time and tide waited for no man  the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again  the fancy ball was lighted up at supper  all things ran their course      viii  monseigneur in the country   a beautiful landscape  with the corn bright in it  but not abundant  patches of poor rye where corn should have been  patches of poor peas and beans  patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat  on inanimate nature  as on the men and women who cultivated it  a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly  a dejected disposition to give up  and wither away   monsieur the marquis in his travelling carriage  which might have been lighter   conducted by four post horses and two postilions  fagged up a steep hill  a blush on the countenance of monsieur the marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding  it was not from within  it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control  the setting sun   the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill top  that its occupant was steeped in crimson   it will die out   said monsieur the marquis  glancing at his hands   directly    in effect  the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment  when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel  and the carriage slid down hill  with a cinderous smell  in a cloud of dust  the red glow departed quickly  the sun and the marquis going down together  there was no glow left when the drag was taken off   but  there remained a broken country  bold and open  a little village at the bottom of the hill  a broad sweep and rise beyond it  a church tower  a windmill  a forest for the chase  and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison  round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on  the marquis looked  with the air of one who was coming near home   the village had its one poor street  with its poor brewery  poor tannery  poor tavern  poor stable yard for relays of post horses  poor fountain  all usual poor appointments  it had its poor people too  all its people were poor  and many of them were sitting at their doors  shredding spare onions and the like for supper  while many were at the fountain  washing leaves  and grasses  and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten  expressive signs of what made them poor  were not wanting  the tax for the state  the tax for the church  the tax for the lord  tax local and tax general  were to be paid here and to be paid there  according to solemn inscription in the little village  until the wonder was  that there was any village left unswallowed   few children were to be seen  and no dogs  as to the men and women  their choice on earth was stated in the prospect  life on the lowest terms that could sustain it  down in the little village under the mill  or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag   heralded by a courier in advance  and by the cracking of his postilions  whips  which twined snake like about their heads in the evening air  as if he came attended by the furies  monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the posting house gate  it was hard by the fountain  and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him  he looked at them  and saw in them  without knowing it  the slow sure filing down of misery worn face and figure  that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years   monsieur the marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him  as the like of himself had drooped before monseigneur of the court  only the difference was  that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate  when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group    bring me hither that fellow   said the marquis to the courier   the fellow was brought  cap in hand  and the other fellows closed round to look and listen  in the manner of the people at the paris fountain    i passed you on the road     monseigneur  it is true  i had the honour of being passed on the road     coming up the hill  and at the top of the hill  both     monseigneur  it is true     what did you look at  so fixedly     monseigneur  i looked at the man    he stooped a little  and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage  all his fellows stooped to look under the carriage    what man  pig  and why look there     pardon  monseigneur  he swung by the chain of the shoe  the drag     who   demanded the traveller    monseigneur  the man     may the devil carry away these idiots  how do you call the man  you know all the men of this part of the country  who was he     your clemency  monseigneur  he was not of this part of the country  of all the days of my life  i never saw him     swinging by the chain  to be suffocated     with your gracious permission  that was the wonder of it  monseigneur  his head hanging over  like this    he turned himself sideways to the carriage  and leaned back  with his face thrown up to the sky  and his head hanging down  then recovered himself  fumbled with his cap  and made a bow    what was he like     monseigneur  he was whiter than the miller  all covered with dust  white as a spectre  tall as a spectre    the picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd  but all eyes  without comparing notes with other eyes  looked at monsieur the marquis  perhaps  to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience    truly  you did well   said the marquis  felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him   to see a thief accompanying my carriage  and not open that great mouth of yours  bah  put him aside  monsieur gabelle    monsieur gabelle was the postmaster  and some other taxing functionary united  he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination  and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner    bah  go aside   said monsieur gabelle    lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to night  and be sure that his business is honest  gabelle     monseigneur  i am flattered to devote myself to your orders     did he run away  fellow   where is that accursed    the accursed was already under the carriage with some half dozen particular friends  pointing out the chain with his blue cap  some half dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out  and presented him breathless to monsieur the marquis    did the man run away  dolt  when we stopped for the drag     monseigneur  he precipitated himself over the hill side  head first  as a person plunges into the river     see to it  gabelle  go on    the half dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels  like sheep  the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones  they had very little else to save  or they might not have been so fortunate   the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond  was soon checked by the steepness of the hill  gradually  it subsided to a foot pace  swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night  the postilions  with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the furies  quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses  the courier was audible  trotting on ahead into the dull distance   at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground  with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it  it was a poor figure in wood  done by some inexperienced rustic carver  but he had studied the figure from the life  his own life  maybe  for it was dreadfully spare and thin   to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse  and was not at its worst  a woman was kneeling  she turned her head as the carriage came up to her  rose quickly  and presented herself at the carriage door    it is you  monseigneur  monseigneur  a petition    with an exclamation of impatience  but with his unchangeable face  monseigneur looked out    how  then  what is it  always petitions     monseigneur  for the love of the great god  my husband  the forester     what of your husband  the forester  always the same with you people  he cannot pay something     he has paid all  monseigneur  he is dead     well  he is quiet  can i restore him to you     alas  no  monseigneur  but he lies yonder  under a little heap of poor grass     well     monseigneur  there are so many little heaps of poor grass     again  well    she looked an old woman  but was young  her manner was one of passionate grief  by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy  and laid one of them on the carriage door  tenderly  caressingly  as if it had been a human breast  and could be expected to feel the appealing touch    monseigneur  hear me  monseigneur  hear my petition  my husband died of want  so many die of want  so many more will die of want     again  well  can i feed them     monseigneur  the good god knows  but i don t ask it  my petition is  that a morsel of stone or wood  with my husband s name  may be placed over him to show where he lies  otherwise  the place will be quickly forgotten  it will never be found when i am dead of the same malady  i shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass  monseigneur  they are so many  they increase so fast  there is so much want  monseigneur  monseigneur    the valet had put her away from the door  the carriage had broken into a brisk trot  the postilions had quickened the pace  she was left far behind  and monseigneur  again escorted by the furies  was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau   the sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him  and rose  as the rain falls  impartially  on the dusty  ragged  and toil worn group at the fountain not far away  to whom the mender of roads  with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing  still enlarged upon his man like a spectre  as long as they could bear it  by degrees  as they could bear no more  they dropped off one by one  and lights twinkled in little casements  which lights  as the casements darkened  and more stars came out  seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished   the shadow of a large high roofed house  and of many over hanging trees  was upon monsieur the marquis by that time  and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau  as his carriage stopped  and the great door of his chateau was opened to him    monsieur charles  whom i expect  is he arrived from england     monseigneur  not yet       ix  the gorgon s head   it was a heavy mass of building  that chateau of monsieur the marquis  with a large stone courtyard before it  and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door  a stony business altogether  with heavy stone balustrades  and stone urns  and stone flowers  and stone faces of men  and stone heads of lions  in all directions  as if the gorgon s head had surveyed it  when it was finished  two centuries ago   up the broad flight of shallow steps  monsieur the marquis  flambeau preceded  went from his carriage  sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees  all else was so quiet  that the flambeau carried up the steps  and the other flambeau held at the great door  burnt as if they were in a close room of state  instead of being in the open night air  other sound than the owl s voice there was none  save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin  for  it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together  and then heave a long low sigh  and hold their breath again   the great door clanged behind him  and monsieur the marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boar spears  swords  and knives of the chase  grimmer with certain heavy riding rods and riding whips  of which many a peasant  gone to his benefactor death  had felt the weight when his lord was angry   avoiding the larger rooms  which were dark and made fast for the night  monsieur the marquis  with his flambeau bearer going on before  went up the staircase to a door in a corridor  this thrown open  admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms  his bed chamber and two others  high vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors  great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time  and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country  the fashion of the last louis but one  of the line that was never to break  the fourteenth louis  was conspicuous in their rich furniture  but  it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of france   a supper table was laid for two  in the third of the rooms  a round room  in one of the chateau s four extinguisher topped towers  a small lofty room  with its window wide open  and the wooden jalousie blinds closed  so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black  alternating with their broad lines of stone colour    my nephew   said the marquis  glancing at the supper preparation   they said he was not arrived    nor was he  but  he had been expected with monseigneur    ah  it is not probable he will arrive to night  nevertheless  leave the table as it is  i shall be ready in a quarter of an hour    in a quarter of an hour monseigneur was ready  and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper  his chair was opposite to the window  and he had taken his soup  and was raising his glass of bordeaux to his lips  when he put it down    what is that   he calmly asked  looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour    monseigneur  that     outside the blinds  open the blinds    it was done    well     monseigneur  it is nothing  the trees and the night are all that are here    the servant who spoke  had thrown the blinds wide  had looked out into the vacant darkness  and stood with that blank behind him  looking round for instructions    good   said the imperturbable master   close them again    that was done too  and the marquis went on with his supper  he was half way through it  when he again stopped with his glass in his hand  hearing the sound of wheels  it came on briskly  and came up to the front of the chateau    ask who is arrived    it was the nephew of monseigneur  he had been some few leagues behind monseigneur  early in the afternoon  he had diminished the distance rapidly  but not so rapidly as to come up with monseigneur on the road  he had heard of monseigneur  at the posting houses  as being before him   he was to be told  said monseigneur  that supper awaited him then and there  and that he was prayed to come to it  in a little while he came  he had been known in england as charles darnay   monseigneur received him in a courtly manner  but they did not shake hands    you left paris yesterday  sir   he said to monseigneur  as he took his seat at table    yesterday  and you     i come direct     from london     yes     you have been a long time coming   said the marquis  with a smile    on the contrary  i come direct     pardon me  i mean  not a long time on the journey  a long time intending the journey     i have been detained by   the nephew stopped a moment in his answer   various business     without doubt   said the polished uncle   so long as a servant was present  no other words passed between them  when coffee had been served and they were alone together  the nephew  looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask  opened a conversation    i have come back  sir  as you anticipate  pursuing the object that took me away  it carried me into great and unexpected peril  but it is a sacred object  and if it had carried me to death i hope it would have sustained me     not to death   said the uncle   it is not necessary to say  to death     i doubt  sir   returned the nephew   whether  if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death  you would have cared to stop me there    the deepened marks in the nose  and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face  looked ominous as to that  the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest  which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring    indeed  sir   pursued the nephew   for anything i know  you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me     no  no  no   said the uncle  pleasantly    but  however that may be   resumed the nephew  glancing at him with deep distrust   i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means  and would know no scruple as to means     my friend  i told you so   said the uncle  with a fine pulsation in the two marks   do me the favour to recall that i told you so  long ago     i recall it     thank you   said the marquis  very sweetly indeed   his tone lingered in the air  almost like the tone of a musical instrument    in effect  sir   pursued the nephew   i believe it to be at once your bad fortune  and my good fortune  that has kept me out of a prison in france here     i do not quite understand   returned the uncle  sipping his coffee   dare i ask you to explain     i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court  and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past  a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely     it is possible   said the uncle  with great calmness   for the honour of the family  i could even resolve to incommode you to that extent  pray excuse me     i perceive that  happily for me  the reception of the day before yesterday was  as usual  a cold one   observed the nephew    i would not say happily  my friend   returned the uncle  with refined politeness   i would not be sure of that  a good opportunity for consideration  surrounded by the advantages of solitude  might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself  but it is useless to discuss the question  i am  as you say  at a disadvantage  these little instruments of correction  these gentle aids to the power and honour of families  these slight favours that might so incommode you  are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity  they are sought by so many  and they are granted  comparatively  to so few  it used not to be so  but france in all such things is changed for the worse  our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar  from this room  many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged  in the next room  my bedroom   one fellow  to our knowledge  was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter  his daughter  we have lost many privileges  a new philosophy has become the mode  and the assertion of our station  in these days  might  i do not go so far as to say would  but might  cause us real inconvenience  all very bad  very bad    the marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff  and shook his head  as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself  that great means of regeneration    we have so asserted our station  both in the old time and in the modern time also   said the nephew  gloomily   that i believe our name to be more detested than any name in france     let us hope so   said the uncle   detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low     there is not   pursued the nephew  in his former tone   a face i can look at  in all this country round about us  which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery     a compliment   said the marquis   to the grandeur of the family  merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur  hah   and he took another gentle little pinch of snuff  and lightly crossed his legs   but  when his nephew  leaning an elbow on the table  covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand  the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness  closeness  and dislike  than was comportable with its wearer s assumption of indifference    repression is the only lasting philosophy  the dark deference of fear and slavery  my friend   observed the marquis   will keep the dogs obedient to the whip  as long as this roof   looking up to it   shuts out the sky    that might not be so long as the marquis supposed  if a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence  and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence  could have been shown to him that night  he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly  fire charred  plunder wrecked rains  as for the roof he vaunted  he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new way  to wit  for ever  from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired  out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets    meanwhile   said the marquis   i will preserve the honour and repose of the family  if you will not  but you must be fatigued  shall we terminate our conference for the night     a moment more     an hour  if you please     sir   said the nephew   we have done wrong  and are reaping the fruits of wrong     we have done wrong   repeated the marquis  with an inquiring smile  and delicately pointing  first to his nephew  then to himself    our family  our honourable family  whose honour is of so much account to both of us  in such different ways  even in my father s time  we did a world of wrong  injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure  whatever it was  why need i speak of my father s time  when it is equally yours  can i separate my father s twin brother  joint inheritor  and next successor  from himself     death has done that   said the marquis    and has left me   answered the nephew   bound to a system that is frightful to me  responsible for it  but powerless in it  seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother s lips  and obey the last look of my dear mother s eyes  which implored me to have mercy and to redress  and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain     seeking them from me  my nephew   said the marquis  touching him on the breast with his forefinger  they were now standing by the hearth   you will for ever seek them in vain  be assured    every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face  was cruelly  craftily  and closely compressed  while he stood looking quietly at his nephew  with his snuff box in his hand  once again he touched him on the breast  as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword  with which  in delicate finesse  he ran him through the body  and said    my friend  i will die  perpetuating the system under which i have lived    when he had said it  he took a culminating pinch of snuff  and put his box in his pocket    better to be a rational creature   he added then  after ringing a small bell on the table   and accept your natural destiny  but you are lost  monsieur charles  i see     this property and france are lost to me   said the nephew  sadly   i renounce them     are they both yours to renounce  france may be  but is the property  it is scarcely worth mentioning  but  is it yet     i had no intention  in the words i used  to claim it yet  if it passed to me from you  to morrow      which i have the vanity to hope is not probable       or twenty years hence      you do me too much honour   said the marquis   still  i prefer that supposition       i would abandon it  and live otherwise and elsewhere  it is little to relinquish  what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin     hah   said the marquis  glancing round the luxurious room    to the eye it is fair enough  here  but seen in its integrity  under the sky  and by the daylight  it is a crumbling tower of waste  mismanagement  extortion  debt  mortgage  oppression  hunger  nakedness  and suffering     hah   said the marquis again  in a well satisfied manner    if it ever becomes mine  it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly  if such a thing is possible  from the weight that drags it down  so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance  may  in another generation  suffer less  but it is not for me  there is a curse on it  and on all this land     and you   said the uncle   forgive my curiosity  do you  under your new philosophy  graciously intend to live     i must do  to live  what others of my countrymen  even with nobility at their backs  may have to do some day  work     in england  for example     yes  the family honour  sir  is safe from me in this country  the family name can suffer from me in no other  for i bear it in no other    the ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed chamber to be lighted  it now shone brightly  through the door of communication  the marquis looked that way  and listened for the retreating step of his valet    england is very attractive to you  seeing how indifferently you have prospered there   he observed then  turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile    i have already said  that for my prospering there  i am sensible i may be indebted to you  sir  for the rest  it is my refuge     they say  those boastful english  that it is the refuge of many  you know a compatriot who has found a refuge there  a doctor     yes     with a daughter     yes     yes   said the marquis   you are fatigued  good night    as he bent his head in his most courtly manner  there was a secrecy in his smiling face  and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words  which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly  at the same time  the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes  and the thin straight lips  and the markings in the nose  curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic    yes   repeated the marquis   a doctor with a daughter  yes  so commences the new philosophy  you are fatigued  good night    it would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his  the nephew looked at him  in vain  in passing on to the door    good night   said the uncle   i look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning  good repose  light monsieur my nephew to his chamber there   and burn monsieur my nephew in his bed  if you will   he added to himself  before he rang his little bell again  and summoned his valet to his own bedroom   the valet come and gone  monsieur the marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber robe  to prepare himself gently for sleep  that hot still night  rustling about the room  his softly slippered feet making no noise on the floor  he moved like a refined tiger   looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort  in story  whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off  or just coming on   he moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom  looking again at the scraps of the day s journey that came unbidden into his mind  the slow toil up the hill at sunset  the setting sun  the descent  the mill  the prison on the crag  the little village in the hollow  the peasants at the fountain  and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage  that fountain suggested the paris fountain  the little bundle lying on the step  the women bending over it  and the tall man with his arms up  crying   dead     i am cool now   said monsieur the marquis   and may go to bed    so  leaving only one light burning on the large hearth  he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him  and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep   the stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours  for three heavy hours  the horses in the stables rattled at their racks  the dogs barked  and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men poets  but it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them   for three heavy hours  the stone faces of the chateau  lion and human  stared blindly at the night  dead darkness lay on all the landscape  dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads  the burial place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another  the figure on the cross might have come down  for anything that could be seen of it  in the village  taxers and taxed were fast asleep  dreaming  perhaps  of banquets  as the starved usually do  and of ease and rest  as the driven slave and the yoked ox may  its lean inhabitants slept soundly  and were fed and freed   the fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard  and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard  both melting away  like the minutes that were falling from the spring of time  through three dark hours  then  the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light  and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened   lighter and lighter  until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees  and poured its radiance over the hill  in the glow  the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood  and the stone faces crimsoned  the carol of the birds was loud and high  and  on the weather beaten sill of the great window of the bed chamber of monsieur the marquis  one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might  at this  the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed  and  with open mouth and dropped under jaw  looked awe stricken   now  the sun was full up  and movement began in the village  casement windows opened  crazy doors were unbarred  and people came forth shivering  chilled  as yet  by the new sweet air  then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population  some  to the fountain  some  to the fields  men and women here  to dig and delve  men and women there  to see to the poor live stock  and lead the bony cows out  to such pasture as could be found by the roadside  in the church and at the cross  a kneeling figure or two  attendant on the latter prayers  the led cow  trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot   the chateau awoke later  as became its quality  but awoke gradually and surely  first  the lonely boar spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old  then  had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine  now  doors and windows were thrown open  horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways  leaves sparkled and rustled at iron grated windows  dogs pulled hard at their chains  and reared impatient to be loosed   all these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life  and the return of morning  surely  not so the ringing of the great bell of the chateau  nor the running up and down the stairs  nor the hurried figures on the terrace  nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere  nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away   what winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads  already at work on the hill top beyond the village  with his day s dinner  not much to carry  lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow s while to peck at  on a heap of stones  had the birds  carrying some grains of it to a distance  dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds  whether or no  the mender of roads ran  on the sultry morning  as if for his life  down the hill  knee high in dust  and never stopped till he got to the fountain   all the people of the village were at the fountain  standing about in their depressed manner  and whispering low  but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise  the led cows  hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them  were looking stupidly on  or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble  which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter  some of the people of the chateau  and some of those of the posting house  and all the taxing authorities  were armed more or less  and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way  that was highly fraught with nothing  already  the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends  and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap  what did all this portend  and what portended the swift hoisting up of monsieur gabelle behind a servant on horseback  and the conveying away of the said gabelle  double laden though the horse was   at a gallop  like a new version of the german ballad of leonora   it portended that there was one stone face too many  up at the chateau   the gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night  and had added the one stone face wanting  the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years   it lay back on the pillow of monsieur the marquis  it was like a fine mask  suddenly startled  made angry  and petrified  driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it  was a knife  round its hilt was a frill of paper  on which was scrawled    drive him fast to his tomb  this  from jacques       x  two promises   more months  to the number of twelve  had come and gone  and mr  charles darnay was established in england as a higher teacher of the french language who was conversant with french literature  in this age  he would have been a professor  in that age  he was a tutor  he read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world  and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy  he could write of them  besides  in sound english  and render them into sound english  such masters were not at that time easily found  princes that had been  and kings that were to be  were not yet of the teacher class  and no ruined nobility had dropped out of tellson s ledgers  to turn cooks and carpenters  as a tutor  whose attainments made the student s way unusually pleasant and profitable  and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge  young mr  darnay soon became known and encouraged  he was well acquainted  more over  with the circumstances of his country  and those were of ever growing interest  so  with great perseverance and untiring industry  he prospered   in london  he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold  nor to lie on beds of roses  if he had had any such exalted expectation  he would not have prospered  he had expected labour  and he found it  and did it and made the best of it  in this  his prosperity consisted   a certain portion of his time was passed at cambridge  where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in european languages  instead of conveying greek and latin through the custom house  the rest of his time he passed in london   now  from the days when it was always summer in eden  to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes  the world of a man has invariably gone one way  charles darnay s way  the way of the love of a woman   he had loved lucie manette from the hour of his danger  he had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice  he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful  as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him  but  he had not yet spoken to her on the subject  the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long  long  dusty roads  the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream  had been done a year  and he had never yet  by so much as a single spoken word  disclosed to her the state of his heart   that he had his reasons for this  he knew full well  it was again a summer day when  lately arrived in london from his college occupation  he turned into the quiet corner in soho  bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to doctor manette  it was the close of the summer day  and he knew lucie to be out with miss pross   he found the doctor reading in his arm chair at a window  the energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness  had been gradually restored to him  he was now a very energetic man indeed  with great firmness of purpose  strength of resolution  and vigour of action  in his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden  as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties  but  this had never been frequently observable  and had grown more and more rare   he studied much  slept little  sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease  and was equably cheerful  to him  now entered charles darnay  at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand    charles darnay  i rejoice to see you  we have been counting on your return these three or four days past  mr  stryver and sydney carton were both here yesterday  and both made you out to be more than due     i am obliged to them for their interest in the matter   he answered  a little coldly as to them  though very warmly as to the doctor   miss manette      is well   said the doctor  as he stopped short   and your return will delight us all  she has gone out on some household matters  but will soon be home     doctor manette  i knew she was from home  i took the opportunity of her being from home  to beg to speak to you    there was a blank silence    yes   said the doctor  with evident constraint   bring your chair here  and speak on    he complied as to the chair  but appeared to find the speaking on less easy    i have had the happiness  doctor manette  of being so intimate here    so he at length began   for some year and a half  that i hope the topic on which i am about to touch may not     he was stayed by the doctor s putting out his hand to stop him  when he had kept it so a little while  he said  drawing it back    is lucie the topic     she is     it is hard for me to speak of her at any time  it is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours  charles darnay     it is a tone of fervent admiration  true homage  and deep love  doctor manette   he said deferentially   there was another blank silence before her father rejoined    i believe it  i do you justice  i believe it    his constraint was so manifest  and it was so manifest  too  that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject  that charles darnay hesitated    shall i go on  sir    another blank    yes  go on     you anticipate what i would say  though you cannot know how earnestly i say it  how earnestly i feel it  without knowing my secret heart  and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden  dear doctor manette  i love your daughter fondly  dearly  disinterestedly  devotedly  if ever there were love in the world  i love her  you have loved yourself  let your old love speak for me    the doctor sat with his face turned away  and his eyes bent on the ground  at the last words  he stretched out his hand again  hurriedly  and cried    not that  sir  let that be  i adjure you  do not recall that    his cry was so like a cry of actual pain  that it rang in charles darnay s ears long after he had ceased  he motioned with the hand he had extended  and it seemed to be an appeal to darnay to pause  the latter so received it  and remained silent    i ask your pardon   said the doctor  in a subdued tone  after some moments   i do not doubt your loving lucie  you may be satisfied of it    he turned towards him in his chair  but did not look at him  or raise his eyes  his chin dropped upon his hand  and his white hair overshadowed his face    have you spoken to lucie     no     nor written     never     it would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father  her father thanks you    he offered his hand  but his eyes did not go with it    i know   said darnay  respectfully   how can i fail to know  doctor manette  i who have seen you together from day to day  that between you and miss manette there is an affection so unusual  so touching  so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured  that it can have few parallels  even in the tenderness between a father and child  i know  doctor manette  how can i fail to know  that  mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman  there is  in her heart  towards you  all the love and reliance of infancy itself  i know that  as in her childhood she had no parent  so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character  united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her  i know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life  you could hardly be invested  in her sight  with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her  i know that when she is clinging to you  the hands of baby  girl  and woman  all in one  are round your neck  i know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age  sees and loves you at my age  loves her mother broken hearted  loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration  i have known this  night and day  since i have known you in your home    her father sat silent  with his face bent down  his breathing was a little quickened  but he repressed all other signs of agitation    dear doctor manette  always knowing this  always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you  i have forborne  and forborne  as long as it was in the nature of man to do it  i have felt  and do even now feel  that to bring my love  even mine  between you  is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself  but i love her  heaven is my witness that i love her     i believe it   answered her father  mournfully   i have thought so before now  i believe it     but  do not believe   said darnay  upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound   that if my fortune were so cast as that  being one day so happy as to make her my wife  i must at any time put any separation between her and you  i could or would breathe a word of what i now say  besides that i should know it to be hopeless  i should know it to be a baseness  if i had any such possibility  even at a remote distance of years  harboured in my thoughts  and hidden in my heart  if it ever had been there  if it ever could be there  i could not now touch this honoured hand    he laid his own upon it as he spoke    no  dear doctor manette  like you  a voluntary exile from france  like you  driven from it by its distractions  oppressions  and miseries  like you  striving to live away from it by my own exertions  and trusting in a happier future  i look only to sharing your fortunes  sharing your life and home  and being faithful to you to the death  not to divide with lucie her privilege as your child  companion  and friend  but to come in aid of it  and bind her closer to you  if such a thing can be    his touch still lingered on her father s hand  answering the touch for a moment  but not coldly  her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair  and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference  a struggle was evidently in his face  a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread    you speak so feelingly and so manfully  charles darnay  that i thank you with all my heart  and will open all my heart  or nearly so  have you any reason to believe that lucie loves you     none  as yet  none     is it the immediate object of this confidence  that you may at once ascertain that  with my knowledge     not even so  i might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks  i might  mistaken or not mistaken  have that hopefulness to morrow     do you seek any guidance from me     i ask none  sir  but i have thought it possible that you might have it in your power  if you should deem it right  to give me some     do you seek any promise from me     i do seek that     what is it     i well understand that  without you  i could have no hope  i well understand that  even if miss manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart  do not think i have the presumption to assume so much  i could retain no place in it against her love for her father     if that be so  do you see what  on the other hand  is involved in it     i understand equally well  that a word from her father in any suitor s favour  would outweigh herself and all the world  for which reason  doctor manette   said darnay  modestly but firmly   i would not ask that word  to save my life     i am sure of it  charles darnay  mysteries arise out of close love  as well as out of wide division  in the former case  they are subtle and delicate  and difficult to penetrate  my daughter lucie is  in this one respect  such a mystery to me  i can make no guess at the state of her heart     may i ask  sir  if you think she is    as he hesitated  her father supplied the rest    is sought by any other suitor     it is what i meant to say    her father considered a little before he answered    you have seen mr  carton here  yourself  mr  stryver is here too  occasionally  if it be at all  it can only be by one of these     or both   said darnay    i had not thought of both  i should not think either  likely  you want a promise from me  tell me what it is     it is  that if miss manette should bring to you at any time  on her own part  such a confidence as i have ventured to lay before you  you will bear testimony to what i have said  and to your belief in it  i hope you may be able to think so well of me  as to urge no influence against me  i say nothing more of my stake in this  this is what i ask  the condition on which i ask it  and which you have an undoubted right to require  i will observe immediately     i give the promise   said the doctor   without any condition  i believe your object to be  purely and truthfully  as you have stated it  i believe your intention is to perpetuate  and not to weaken  the ties between me and my other and far dearer self  if she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness  i will give her to you  if there were  charles darnay  if there were     the young man had taken his hand gratefully  their hands were joined as the doctor spoke      any fancies  any reasons  any apprehensions  anything whatsoever  new or old  against the man she really loved  the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head  they should all be obliterated for her sake  she is everything to me  more to me than suffering  more to me than wrong  more to me  well  this is idle talk    so strange was the way in which he faded into silence  and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak  that darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it    you said something to me   said doctor manette  breaking into a smile   what was it you said to me    he was at a loss how to answer  until he remembered having spoken of a condition  relieved as his mind reverted to that  he answered    your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part  my present name  though but slightly changed from my mother s  is not  as you will remember  my own  i wish to tell you what that is  and why i am in england     stop   said the doctor of beauvais    i wish it  that i may the better deserve your confidence  and have no secret from you     stop    for an instant  the doctor even had his two hands at his ears  for another instant  even had his two hands laid on darnay s lips    tell me when i ask you  not now  if your suit should prosper  if lucie should love you  you shall tell me on your marriage morning  do you promise     willingly    give me your hand  she will be home directly  and it is better she should not see us together to night  go  god bless you    it was dark when charles darnay left him  and it was an hour later and darker when lucie came home  she hurried into the room alone  for miss pross had gone straight up stairs  and was surprised to find his reading chair empty    my father   she called to him   father dear    nothing was said in answer  but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom  passing lightly across the intermediate room  she looked in at his door and came running back frightened  crying to herself  with her blood all chilled   what shall i do  what shall i do    her uncertainty lasted but a moment  she hurried back  and tapped at his door  and softly called to him  the noise ceased at the sound of her voice  and he presently came out to her  and they walked up and down together for a long time   she came down from her bed  to look at him in his sleep that night  he slept heavily  and his tray of shoemaking tools  and his old unfinished work  were all as usual      xi  a companion picture    sydney   said mr  stryver  on that self same night  or morning  to his jackal   mix another bowl of punch  i have something to say to you    sydney had been working double tides that night  and the night before  and the night before that  and a good many nights in succession  making a grand clearance among mr  stryver s papers before the setting in of the long vacation  the clearance was effected at last  the stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up  everything was got rid of until november should come with its fogs atmospheric  and fogs legal  and bring grist to the mill again   sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application  it had taken a deal of extra wet towelling to pull him through the night  a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling  and he was in a very damaged condition  as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours    are you mixing that other bowl of punch   said stryver the portly  with his hands in his waistband  glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back    i am     now  look here  i am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you  and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me  i intend to marry     do you     yes  and not for money  what do you say now     i don t feel disposed to say much  who is she     guess     do i know her     guess     i am not going to guess  at five o clock in the morning  with my brains frying and sputtering in my head  if you want me to guess  you must ask me to dinner     well then  i ll tell you   said stryver  coming slowly into a sitting posture   sydney  i rather despair of making myself intelligible to you  because you are such an insensible dog     and you   returned sydney  busy concocting the punch   are such a sensitive and poetical spirit      come   rejoined stryver  laughing boastfully   though i don t prefer any claim to being the soul of romance  for i hope i know better   still i am a tenderer sort of fellow than you     you are a luckier  if you mean that     i don t mean that  i mean i am a man of more  more      say gallantry  while you are about it   suggested carton    well  i ll say gallantry  my meaning is that i am a man   said stryver  inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch   who cares more to be agreeable  who takes more pains to be agreeable  who knows better how to be agreeable  in a woman s society  than you do     go on   said sydney carton    no  but before i go on   said stryver  shaking his head in his bullying way   i ll have this out with you  you ve been at doctor manette s house as much as i have  or more than i have  why  i have been ashamed of your moroseness there  your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind  that  upon my life and soul  i have been ashamed of you  sydney     it should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar  to be ashamed of anything   returned sydney   you ought to be much obliged to me     you shall not get off in that way   rejoined stryver  shouldering the rejoinder at him   no  sydney  it s my duty to tell you  and i tell you to your face to do you good  that you are a devilish ill conditioned fellow in that sort of society  you are a disagreeable fellow    sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made  and laughed    look at me   said stryver  squaring himself   i have less need to make myself agreeable than you have  being more independent in circumstances  why do i do it     i never saw you do it yet   muttered carton    i do it because it s politic  i do it on principle  and look at me  i get on     you don t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions    answered carton  with a careless air   i wish you would keep to that  as to me  will you never understand that i am incorrigible    he asked the question with some appearance of scorn    you have no business to be incorrigible   was his friend s answer  delivered in no very soothing tone    i have no business to be  at all  that i know of   said sydney carton   who is the lady     now  don t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable  sydney   said mr  stryver  preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make   because i know you don t mean half you say  and if you meant it all  it would be of no importance  i make this little preface  because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms     i did     certainly  and in these chambers    sydney carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend  drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend    you made mention of the young lady as a golden haired doll  the young lady is miss manette  if you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way  sydney  i might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation  but you are not  you want that sense altogether  therefore i am no more annoyed when i think of the expression  than i should be annoyed by a man s opinion of a picture of mine  who had no eye for pictures  or of a piece of music of mine  who had no ear for music    sydney carton drank the punch at a great rate  drank it by bumpers  looking at his friend    now you know all about it  syd   said mr  stryver   i don t care about fortune  she is a charming creature  and i have made up my mind to please myself  on the whole  i think i can afford to please myself  she will have in me a man already pretty well off  and a rapidly rising man  and a man of some distinction  it is a piece of good fortune for her  but she is worthy of good fortune  are you astonished    carton  still drinking the punch  rejoined   why should i be astonished     you approve    carton  still drinking the punch  rejoined   why should i not approve     well   said his friend stryver   you take it more easily than i fancied you would  and are less mercenary on my behalf than i thought you would be  though  to be sure  you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will  yes  sydney  i have had enough of this style of life  with no other as a change from it  i feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it  when he doesn t  he can stay away   and i feel that miss manette will tell well in any station  and will always do me credit  so i have made up my mind  and now  sydney  old boy  i want to say a word to you about your prospects  you are in a bad way  you know  you really are in a bad way  you don t know the value of money  you live hard  you ll knock up one of these days  and be ill and poor  you really ought to think about a nurse    the prosperous patronage with which he said it  made him look twice as big as he was  and four times as offensive    now  let me recommend you   pursued stryver   to look it in the face  i have looked it in the face  in my different way  look it in the face  you  in your different way  marry  provide somebody to take care of you  never mind your having no enjoyment of women s society  nor understanding of it  nor tact for it  find out somebody  find out some respectable woman with a little property  somebody in the landlady way  or lodging letting way  and marry her  against a rainy day  that s the kind of thing for you  now think of it  sydney     i ll think of it   said sydney      xii  the fellow of delicacy   mr  stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the doctor s daughter  resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the long vacation  after some mental debating of the point  he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with  and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before michaelmas term  or in the little christmas vacation between it and hilary   as to the strength of his case  he had not a doubt about it  but clearly saw his way to the verdict  argued with the jury on substantial worldly grounds  the only grounds ever worth taking into account  it was a plain case  and had not a weak spot in it  he called himself for the plaintiff  there was no getting over his evidence  the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief  and the jury did not even turn to consider  after trying it  stryver  c  j   was satisfied that no plainer case could be   accordingly  mr  stryver inaugurated the long vacation with a formal proposal to take miss manette to vauxhall gardens  that failing  to ranelagh  that unaccountably failing too  it behoved him to present himself in soho  and there declare his noble mind   towards soho  therefore  mr  stryver shouldered his way from the temple  while the bloom of the long vacation s infancy was still upon it  anybody who had seen him projecting himself into soho while he was yet on saint dunstan s side of temple bar  bursting in his full blown way along the pavement  to the jostlement of all weaker people  might have seen how safe and strong he was   his way taking him past tellson s  and he both banking at tellson s and knowing mr  lorry as the intimate friend of the manettes  it entered mr  stryver s mind to enter the bank  and reveal to mr  lorry the brightness of the soho horizon  so  he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat  stumbled down the two steps  got past the two ancient cashiers  and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where mr  lorry sat at great books ruled for figures  with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too  and everything under the clouds were a sum    halloa   said mr  stryver   how do you do  i hope you are well    it was stryver s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place  or space  he was so much too big for tellson s  that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance  as though he squeezed them against the wall  the house itself  magnificently reading the paper quite in the far off perspective  lowered displeased  as if the stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat   the discreet mr  lorry said  in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances   how do you do  mr  stryver  how do you do  sir   and shook hands  there was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands  always to be seen in any clerk at tellson s who shook hands with a customer when the house pervaded the air  he shook in a self abnegating way  as one who shook for tellson and co    can i do anything for you  mr  stryver   asked mr  lorry  in his business character    why  no  thank you  this is a private visit to yourself  mr  lorry  i have come for a private word     oh indeed   said mr  lorry  bending down his ear  while his eye strayed to the house afar off    i am going   said mr  stryver  leaning his arms confidentially on the desk  whereupon  although it was a large double one  there appeared to be not half desk enough for him   i am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend  miss manette  mr  lorry     oh dear me   cried mr  lorry  rubbing his chin  and looking at his visitor dubiously    oh dear me  sir   repeated stryver  drawing back   oh dear you  sir  what may your meaning be  mr  lorry     my meaning   answered the man of business   is  of course  friendly and appreciative  and that it does you the greatest credit  and  in short  my meaning is everything you could desire  but  really  you know  mr  stryver    mr  lorry paused  and shook his head at him in the oddest manner  as if he were compelled against his will to add  internally   you know there really is so much too much of you     well   said stryver  slapping the desk with his contentious hand  opening his eyes wider  and taking a long breath   if i understand you  mr  lorry  i ll be hanged    mr  lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end  and bit the feather of a pen    d  n it all  sir   said stryver  staring at him   am i not eligible     oh dear yes  yes  oh yes  you re eligible   said mr  lorry   if you say eligible  you are eligible     am i not prosperous   asked stryver    oh  if you come to prosperous  you are prosperous   said mr  lorry    and advancing     if you come to advancing you know   said mr  lorry  delighted to be able to make another admission   nobody can doubt that     then what on earth is your meaning  mr  lorry   demanded stryver  perceptibly crestfallen    well  i  were you going there now   asked mr  lorry    straight   said stryver  with a plump of his fist on the desk    then i think i wouldn t  if i was you     why   said stryver   now  i ll put you in a corner   forensically shaking a forefinger at him   you are a man of business and bound to have a reason  state your reason  why wouldn t you go     because   said mr  lorry   i wouldn t go on such an object without having some cause to believe that i should succeed     d  n me   cried stryver   but this beats everything    mr  lorry glanced at the distant house  and glanced at the angry stryver    here s a man of business  a man of years  a man of experience  in a bank   said stryver   and having summed up three leading reasons for complete success  he says there s no reason at all  says it with his head on   mr  stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off    when i speak of success  i speak of success with the young lady  and when i speak of causes and reasons to make success probable  i speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady  the young lady  my good sir   said mr  lorry  mildly tapping the stryver arm   the young lady  the young lady goes before all     then you mean to tell me  mr  lorry   said stryver  squaring his elbows   that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing fool     not exactly so  i mean to tell you  mr  stryver   said mr  lorry  reddening   that i will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips  and that if i knew any man  which i hope i do not  whose taste was so coarse  and whose temper was so overbearing  that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk  not even tellson s should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind    the necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put mr  stryver s blood vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry  mr  lorry s veins  methodical as their courses could usually be  were in no better state now it was his turn    that is what i mean to tell you  sir   said mr  lorry   pray let there be no mistake about it    mr  stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while  and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it  which probably gave him the toothache  he broke the awkward silence by saying    this is something new to me  mr  lorry  you deliberately advise me not to go up to soho and offer myself  myself  stryver of the king s bench bar     do you ask me for my advice  mr  stryver     yes  i do     very good  then i give it  and you have repeated it correctly     and all i can say of it is   laughed stryver with a vexed laugh   that this  ha  ha   beats everything past  present  and to come     now understand me   pursued mr  lorry   as a man of business  i am not justified in saying anything about this matter  for  as a man of business  i know nothing of it  but  as an old fellow  who has carried miss manette in his arms  who is the trusted friend of miss manette and of her father too  and who has a great affection for them both  i have spoken  the confidence is not of my seeking  recollect  now  you think i may not be right     not i   said stryver  whistling   i can t undertake to find third parties in common sense  i can only find it for myself  i suppose sense in certain quarters  you suppose mincing bread and butter nonsense  it s new to me  but you are right  i dare say     what i suppose  mr  stryver  i claim to characterise for myself  and understand me  sir   said mr  lorry  quickly flushing again   i will not  not even at tellson s  have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing     there  i beg your pardon   said stryver    granted  thank you  well  mr  stryver  i was about to say   it might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken  it might be painful to doctor manette to have the task of being explicit with you  it might be very painful to miss manette to have the task of being explicit with you  you know the terms upon which i have the honour and happiness to stand with the family  if you please  committing you in no way  representing you in no way  i will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it  if you should then be dissatisfied with it  you can but test its soundness for yourself  if  on the other hand  you should be satisfied with it  and it should be what it now is  it may spare all sides what is best spared  what do you say     how long would you keep me in town     oh  it is only a question of a few hours  i could go to soho in the evening  and come to your chambers afterwards     then i say yes   said stryver   i won t go up there now  i am not so hot upon it as that comes to  i say yes  and i shall expect you to look in to night  good morning    then mr  stryver turned and burst out of the bank  causing such a concussion of air on his passage through  that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters  required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks  those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing  and were popularly believed  when they had bowed a customer out  still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in   the barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty  unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow  he got it down   and now   said mr  stryver  shaking his forensic forefinger at the temple in general  when it was down   my way out of this  is  to put you all in the wrong    it was a bit of the art of an old bailey tactician  in which he found great relief   you shall not put me in the wrong  young lady   said mr  stryver   i ll do that for you    accordingly  when mr  lorry called that night as late as ten o clock  mr  stryver  among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose  seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning  he even showed surprise when he saw mr  lorry  and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state    well   said that good natured emissary  after a full half hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question   i have been to soho     to soho   repeated mr  stryver  coldly   oh  to be sure  what am i thinking of     and i have no doubt   said mr  lorry   that i was right in the conversation we had  my opinion is confirmed  and i reiterate my advice     i assure you   returned mr  stryver  in the friendliest way   that i am sorry for it on your account  and sorry for it on the poor father s account  i know this must always be a sore subject with the family  let us say no more about it     i don t understand you   said mr  lorry    i dare say not   rejoined stryver  nodding his head in a smoothing and final way   no matter  no matter     but it does matter   mr  lorry urged    no it doesn t  i assure you it doesn t  having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense  and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition  i am well out of my mistake  and no harm is done  young women have committed similar follies often before  and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before  in an unselfish aspect  i am sorry that the thing is dropped  because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view  in a selfish aspect  i am glad that the thing has dropped  because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view  it is hardly necessary to say i could have gained nothing by it  there is no harm at all done  i have not proposed to the young lady  and  between ourselves  i am by no means certain  on reflection  that i ever should have committed myself to that extent  mr  lorry  you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty headed girls  you must not expect to do it  or you will always be disappointed  now  pray say no more about it  i tell you  i regret it on account of others  but i am satisfied on my own account  and i am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you  and for giving me your advice  you know the young lady better than i do  you were right  it never would have done    mr  lorry was so taken aback  that he looked quite stupidly at mr  stryver shouldering him towards the door  with an appearance of showering generosity  forbearance  and goodwill  on his erring head   make the best of it  my dear sir   said stryver   say no more about it  thank you again for allowing me to sound you  good night    mr  lorry was out in the night  before he knew where he was  mr  stryver was lying back on his sofa  winking at his ceiling      xiii  the fellow of no delicacy   if sydney carton ever shone anywhere  he certainly never shone in the house of doctor manette  he had been there often  during a whole year  and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there  when he cared to talk  he talked well  but  the cloud of caring for nothing  which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness  was very rarely pierced by the light within him   and yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house  and for the senseless stones that made their pavements  many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there  when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him  many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there  and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief  removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings  as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things  else forgotten and unattainable  into his mind  of late  the neglected bed in the temple court had known him more scantily than ever  and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes  he had got up again  and haunted that neighbourhood   on a day in august  when mr  stryver  after notifying to his jackal that  he had thought better of that marrying matter   had carried his delicacy into devonshire  and when the sight and scent of flowers in the city streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst  of health for the sickliest  and of youth for the oldest  sydney s feet still trod those stones  from being irresolute and purposeless  his feet became animated by an intention  and  in the working out of that intention  they took him to the doctor s door   he was shown up stairs  and found lucie at her work  alone  she had never been quite at her ease with him  and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table  but  looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common places  she observed a change in it    i fear you are not well  mr  carton     no  but the life i lead  miss manette  is not conducive to health  what is to be expected of  or by  such profligates     is it not  forgive me  i have begun the question on my lips  a pity to live no better life     god knows it is a shame     then why not change it    looking gently at him again  she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes  there were tears in his voice too  as he answered    it is too late for that  i shall never be better than i am  i shall sink lower  and be worse    he leaned an elbow on her table  and covered his eyes with his hand  the table trembled in the silence that followed   she had never seen him softened  and was much distressed  he knew her to be so  without looking at her  and said    pray forgive me  miss manette  i break down before the knowledge of what i want to say to you  will you hear me     if it will do you any good  mr  carton  if it would make you happier  it would make me very glad     god bless you for your sweet compassion    he unshaded his face after a little while  and spoke steadily    don t be afraid to hear me  don t shrink from anything i say  i am like one who died young  all my life might have been     no  mr  carton  i am sure that the best part of it might still be  i am sure that you might be much  much worthier of yourself     say of you  miss manette  and although i know better  although in the mystery of my own wretched heart i know better  i shall never forget it    she was pale and trembling  he came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden    if it had been possible  miss manette  that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourself  flung away  wasted  drunken  poor creature of misuse as you know him to be  he would have been conscious this day and hour  in spite of his happiness  that he would bring you to misery  bring you to sorrow and repentance  blight you  disgrace you  pull you down with him  i know very well that you can have no tenderness for me  i ask for none  i am even thankful that it cannot be     without it  can i not save you  mr  carton  can i not recall you  forgive me again   to a better course  can i in no way repay your confidence  i know this is a confidence   she modestly said  after a little hesitation  and in earnest tears   i know you would say this to no one else  can i turn it to no good account for yourself  mr  carton    he shook his head    to none  no  miss manette  to none  if you will hear me through a very little more  all you can ever do for me is done  i wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul  in my degradation i have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father  and of this home made such a home by you  has stirred old shadows that i thought had died out of me  since i knew you  i have been troubled by a remorse that i thought would never reproach me again  and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward  that i thought were silent for ever  i have had unformed ideas of striving afresh  beginning anew  shaking off sloth and sensuality  and fighting out the abandoned fight  a dream  all a dream  that ends in nothing  and leaves the sleeper where he lay down  but i wish you to know that you inspired it     will nothing of it remain  o mr  carton  think again  try again     no  miss manette  all through it  i have known myself to be quite undeserving  and yet i have had the weakness  and have still the weakness  to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me  heap of ashes that i am  into fire  a fire  however  inseparable in its nature from myself  quickening nothing  lighting nothing  doing no service  idly burning away     since it is my misfortune  mr  carton  to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me      don t say that  miss manette  for you would have reclaimed me  if anything could  you will not be the cause of my becoming worse     since the state of your mind that you describe  is  at all events  attributable to some influence of mine  this is what i mean  if i can make it plain  can i use no influence to serve you  have i no power for good  with you  at all     the utmost good that i am capable of now  miss manette  i have come here to realise  let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life  the remembrance that i opened my heart to you  last of all the world  and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity     which i entreated you to believe  again and again  most fervently  with all my heart  was capable of better things  mr  carton     entreat me to believe it no more  miss manette  i have proved myself  and i know better  i distress you  i draw fast to an end  will you let me believe  when i recall this day  that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast  and that it lies there alone  and will be shared by no one     if that will be a consolation to you  yes     not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you     mr  carton   she answered  after an agitated pause   the secret is yours  not mine  and i promise to respect it     thank you  and again  god bless you    he put her hand to his lips  and moved towards the door    be under no apprehension  miss manette  of my ever resuming this conversation by so much as a passing word  i will never refer to it again  if i were dead  that could not be surer than it is henceforth  in the hour of my death  i shall hold sacred the one good remembrance  and shall thank and bless you for it  that my last avowal of myself was made to you  and that my name  and faults  and miseries were gently carried in your heart  may it otherwise be light and happy    he was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be  and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away  and how much he every day kept down and perverted  that lucie manette wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her    be comforted   he said   i am not worth such feeling  miss manette  an hour or two hence  and the low companions and low habits that i scorn but yield to  will render me less worth such tears as those  than any wretch who creeps along the streets  be comforted  but  within myself  i shall always be  towards you  what i am now  though outwardly i shall be what you have heretofore seen me  the last supplication but one i make to you  is  that you will believe this of me     i will  mr  carton     my last supplication of all  is this  and with it  i will relieve you of a visitor with whom i well know you have nothing in unison  and between whom and you there is an impassable space  it is useless to say it  i know  but it rises out of my soul  for you  and for any dear to you  i would do anything  if my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it  i would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you  try to hold me in your mind  at some quiet times  as ardent and sincere in this one thing  the time will come  the time will not be long in coming  when new ties will be formed about you  ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn  the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you  o miss manette  when the little picture of a happy father s face looks up in yours  when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet  think now and then that there is a man who would give his life  to keep a life you love beside you    he said   farewell   said a last  god bless you   and left her      xiv  the honest tradesman   to the eyes of mr  jeremiah cruncher  sitting on his stool in fleet street with his grisly urchin beside him  a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented  who could sit upon anything in fleet street during the busy hours of the day  and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions  one ever tending westward with the sun  the other ever tending eastward from the sun  both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down   with his straw in his mouth  mr  cruncher sat watching the two streams  like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream  saving that jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry  nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind  since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women  mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life  from tellson s side of the tides to the opposite shore  brief as such companionship was in every separate instance  mr  cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health  and it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose  that he recruited his finances  as just now observed   time was  when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place  and mused in the sight of men  mr  cruncher  sitting on a stool in a public place  but not being a poet  mused as little as possible  and looked about him   it fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few  and belated women few  and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that mrs  cruncher must have been  flopping  in some pointed manner  when an unusual concourse pouring down fleet street westward  attracted his attention  looking that way  mr  cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along  and that there was popular objection to this funeral  which engendered uproar    young jerry   said mr  cruncher  turning to his offspring   it s a buryin      hooroar  father   cried young jerry   the young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance  the elder gentleman took the cry so ill  that he watched his opportunity  and smote the young gentleman on the ear    what d ye mean  what are you hooroaring at  what do you want to conwey to your own father  you young rip  this boy is a getting too many for me   said mr  cruncher  surveying him   him and his hooroars  don t let me hear no more of you  or you shall feel some more of me  d ye hear     i warn t doing no harm   young jerry protested  rubbing his cheek    drop it then   said mr  cruncher   i won t have none of your no harms  get a top of that there seat  and look at the crowd    his son obeyed  and the crowd approached  they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach  in which mourning coach there was only one mourner  dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position  the position appeared by no means to please him  however  with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach  deriding him  making grimaces at him  and incessantly groaning and calling out   yah  spies  tst  yaha  spies    with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat   funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for mr  cruncher  he always pricked up his senses  and became excited  when a funeral passed tellson s  naturally  therefore  a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly  and he asked of the first man who ran against him    what is it  brother  what s it about     i don t know   said the man   spies  yaha  tst  spies    he asked another man   who is it     i don t know   returned the man  clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless  and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour   spies  yaha  tst  tst  spi  ies    at length  a person better informed on the merits of the case  tumbled against him  and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one roger cly    was he a spy   asked mr  cruncher    old bailey spy   returned his informant   yaha  tst  yah  old bailey spi  i  ies     why  to be sure   exclaimed jerry  recalling the trial at which he had assisted   i ve seen him  dead  is he     dead as mutton   returned the other   and can t be too dead  have  em out  there  spies  pull  em out  there  spies    the idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea  that the crowd caught it up with eagerness  and loudly repeating the suggestion to have  em out  and to pull  em out  mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop  on the crowd s opening the coach doors  the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands for a moment  but he was so alert  and made such good use of his time  that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye street  after shedding his cloak  hat  long hatband  white pocket handkerchief  and other symbolical tears   these  the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment  while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops  for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing  and was a monster much dreaded  they had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out  when some brighter genius proposed instead  its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing  practical suggestions being much needed  this suggestion  too  was received with acclamation  and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out  while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it  among the first of these volunteers was jerry cruncher himself  who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of tellson s  in the further corner of the mourning coach   the officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies  but  the river being alarmingly near  and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason  the protest was faint and brief  the remodelled procession started  with a chimney sweep driving the hearse  advised by the regular driver  who was perched beside him  under close inspection  for the purpose  and with a pieman  also attended by his cabinet minister  driving the mourning coach  a bear leader  a popular street character of the time  was impressed as an additional ornament  before the cavalcade had gone far down the strand  and his bear  who was black and very mangy  gave quite an undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked   thus  with beer drinking  pipe smoking  song roaring  and infinite caricaturing of woe  the disorderly procession went its way  recruiting at every step  and all the shops shutting up before it  its destination was the old church of saint pancras  far off in the fields  it got there in course of time  insisted on pouring into the burial ground  finally  accomplished the interment of the deceased roger cly in its own way  and highly to its own satisfaction   the dead man disposed of  and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself  another brighter genius  or perhaps the same  conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers by  as old bailey spies  and wreaking vengeance on them  chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the old bailey in their lives  in the realisation of this fancy  and they were roughly hustled and maltreated  the transition to the sport of window breaking  and thence to the plundering of public houses  was easy and natural  at last  after several hours  when sundry summer houses had been pulled down  and some area railings had been torn up  to arm the more belligerent spirits  a rumour got about that the guards were coming  before this rumour  the crowd gradually melted away  and perhaps the guards came  and perhaps they never came  and this was the usual progress of a mob   mr  cruncher did not assist at the closing sports  but had remained behind in the churchyard  to confer and condole with the undertakers  the place had a soothing influence on him  he procured a pipe from a neighbouring public house  and smoked it  looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot    jerry   said mr  cruncher  apostrophising himself in his usual way   you see that there cly that day  and you see with your own eyes that he was a young  un and a straight made  un    having smoked his pipe out  and ruminated a little longer  he turned himself about  that he might appear  before the hour of closing  on his station at tellson s  whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver  or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss  or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man  is not so much to the purpose  as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser  a distinguished surgeon  on his way back   young jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest  and reported no job in his absence  the bank closed  the ancient clerks came out  the usual watch was set  and mr  cruncher and his son went home to tea    now  i tell you where it is   said mr  cruncher to his wife  on entering   if  as a honest tradesman  my wenturs goes wrong to night  i shall make sure that you ve been praying again me  and i shall work you for it just the same as if i seen you do it    the dejected mrs  cruncher shook her head    why  you re at it afore my face   said mr  cruncher  with signs of angry apprehension    i am saying nothing     well  then  don t meditate nothing  you might as well flop as meditate  you may as well go again me one way as another  drop it altogether     yes  jerry     yes  jerry   repeated mr  cruncher sitting down to tea   ah  it is yes  jerry  that s about it  you may say yes  jerry    mr  cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations  but made use of them  as people not unfrequently do  to express general ironical dissatisfaction    you and your yes  jerry   said mr  cruncher  taking a bite out of his bread and butter  and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer   ah  i think so  i believe you     you are going out to night   asked his decent wife  when he took another bite    yes  i am     may i go with you  father   asked his son  briskly    no  you mayn t  i m a going  as your mother knows  a fishing  that s where i m going to  going a fishing     your fishing rod gets rayther rusty  don t it  father     never you mind     shall you bring any fish home  father     if i don t  you ll have short commons  to morrow   returned that gentleman  shaking his head   that s questions enough for you  i ain t a going out  till you ve been long abed    he devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on mrs  cruncher  and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage  with this view  he urged his son to hold her in conversation also  and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her  rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections  the devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife  it was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story    and mind you   said mr  cruncher   no games to morrow  if i  as a honest tradesman  succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two  none of your not touching of it  and sticking to bread  if i  as a honest tradesman  am able to provide a little beer  none of your declaring on water  when you go to rome  do as rome does  rome will be a ugly customer to you  if you don t  i m your rome  you know    then he began grumbling again    with your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink  i don t know how scarce you mayn t make the wittles and drink here  by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct  look at your boy  he is your n  ain t he  he s as thin as a lath  do you call yourself a mother  and not know that a mother s first duty is to blow her boy out    this touched young jerry on a tender place  who adjured his mother to perform her first duty  and  whatever else she did or neglected  above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent   thus the evening wore away with the cruncher family  until young jerry was ordered to bed  and his mother  laid under similar injunctions  obeyed them  mr  cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes  and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o clock  towards that small and ghostly hour  he rose up from his chair  took a key out of his pocket  opened a locked cupboard  and brought forth a sack  a crowbar of convenient size  a rope and chain  and other fishing tackle of that nature  disposing these articles about him in skilful manner  he bestowed a parting defiance on mrs  cruncher  extinguished the light  and went out   young jerry  who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed  was not long after his father  under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room  followed down the stairs  followed down the court  followed out into the streets  he was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again  for it was full of lodgers  and the door stood ajar all night   impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father s honest calling  young jerry  keeping as close to house fronts  walls  and doorways  as his eyes were close to one another  held his honoured parent in view  the honoured parent steering northward  had not gone far  when he was joined by another disciple of izaak walton  and the two trudged on together   within half an hour from the first starting  they were beyond the winking lamps  and the more than winking watchmen  and were out upon a lonely road  another fisherman was picked up here  and that so silently  that if young jerry had been superstitious  he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have  all of a sudden  split himself into two   the three went on  and young jerry went on  until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road  upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall  surmounted by an iron railing  in the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road  and up a blind lane  of which the wall  there  risen to some eight or ten feet high  formed one side  crouching down in a corner  peeping up the lane  the next object that young jerry saw  was the form of his honoured parent  pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon  nimbly scaling an iron gate  he was soon over  and then the second fisherman got over  and then the third  they all dropped softly on the ground within the gate  and lay there a little  listening perhaps  then  they moved away on their hands and knees   it was now young jerry s turn to approach the gate  which he did  holding his breath  crouching down again in a corner there  and looking in  he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass  and all the gravestones in the churchyard  it was a large churchyard that they were in  looking on like ghosts in white  while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant  they did not creep far  before they stopped and stood upright  and then they began to fish   they fished with a spade  at first  presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew  whatever tools they worked with  they worked hard  until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified young jerry  that he made off  with his hair as stiff as his father s   but  his long cherished desire to know more about these matters  not only stopped him in his running away  but lured him back again  they were still fishing perseveringly  when he peeped in at the gate for the second time  but  now they seemed to have got a bite  there was a screwing and complaining sound down below  and their bent figures were strained  as if by a weight  by slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it  and came to the surface  young jerry very well knew what it would be  but  when he saw it  and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open  he was so frightened  being new to the sight  that he made off again  and never stopped until he had run a mile or more   he would not have stopped then  for anything less necessary than breath  it being a spectral sort of race that he ran  and one highly desirable to get to the end of  he had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him  and  pictured as hopping on behind him  bolt upright  upon its narrow end  always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side  perhaps taking his arm  it was a pursuer to shun  it was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too  for  while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful  he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys  fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy s kite without tail and wings  it hid in doorways too  rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors  and drawing them up to its ears  as if it were laughing  it got into shadows on the road  and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up  all this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him  so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead  and even then it would not leave him  but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair  scrambled into bed with him  and bumped down  dead and heavy  on his breast when he fell asleep   from his oppressed slumber  young jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise  by the presence of his father in the family room  something had gone wrong with him  at least  so young jerry inferred  from the circumstance of his holding mrs  cruncher by the ears  and knocking the back of her head against the head board of the bed    i told you i would   said mr  cruncher   and i did     jerry  jerry  jerry   his wife implored    you oppose yourself to the profit of the business   said jerry   and me and my partners suffer  you was to honour and obey  why the devil don t you     i try to be a good wife  jerry   the poor woman protested  with tears    is it being a good wife to oppose your husband s business  is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business  is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business     you hadn t taken to the dreadful business then  jerry     it s enough for you   retorted mr  cruncher   to be the wife of a honest tradesman  and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn t  a honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether  call yourself a religious woman  if you re a religious woman  give me a irreligious one  you have no more nat ral sense of duty than the bed of this here thames river has of a pile  and similarly it must be knocked into you    the altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice  and terminated in the honest tradesman s kicking off his clay soiled boots  and lying down at his length on the floor  after taking a timid peep at him lying on his back  with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow  his son lay down too  and fell asleep again   there was no fish for breakfast  and not much of anything else  mr  cruncher was out of spirits  and out of temper  and kept an iron pot lid by him as a projectile for the correction of mrs  cruncher  in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying grace  he was brushed and washed at the usual hour  and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling   young jerry  walking with the stool under his arm at his father s side along sunny and crowded fleet street  was a very different young jerry from him of the previous night  running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer  his cunning was fresh with the day  and his qualms were gone with the night  in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in fleet street and the city of london  that fine morning    father   said young jerry  as they walked along  taking care to keep at arm s length and to have the stool well between them   what s a resurrection man    mr  cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered   how should i know     i thought you knowed everything  father   said the artless boy    hem  well   returned mr  cruncher  going on again  and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play   he s a tradesman     what s his goods  father   asked the brisk young jerry    his goods   said mr  cruncher  after turning it over in his mind   is a branch of scientific goods     persons  bodies  ain t it  father   asked the lively boy    i believe it is something of that sort   said mr  cruncher    oh  father  i should so like to be a resurrection man when i m quite growed up    mr  cruncher was soothed  but shook his head in a dubious and moral way   it depends upon how you dewelop your talents  be careful to dewelop your talents  and never to say no more than you can help to nobody  and there s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for   as young jerry  thus encouraged  went on a few yards in advance  to plant the stool in the shadow of the bar  mr  cruncher added to himself   jerry  you honest tradesman  there s hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you  and a recompense to you for his mother       xv  knitting   there had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine shop of monsieur defarge  as early as six o clock in the morning  sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within  bending over measures of wine  monsieur defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times  but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time  a sour wine  moreover  or a souring  for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy  no vivacious bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of monsieur defarge  but  a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark  lay hidden in the dregs of it   this had been the third morning in succession  on which there had been early drinking at the wine shop of monsieur defarge  it had begun on monday  and here was wednesday come  there had been more of early brooding than drinking  for  many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door  who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls  these were to the full as interested in the place  however  as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine  and they glided from seat to seat  and from corner to corner  swallowing talk in lieu of drink  with greedy looks   notwithstanding an unusual flow of company  the master of the wine shop was not visible  he was not missed  for  nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him  nobody asked for him  nobody wondered to see only madame defarge in her seat  presiding over the distribution of wine  with a bowl of battered small coins before her  as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come   a suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind  were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine shop  as they looked in at every place  high and low  from the king s palace to the criminal s gaol  games at cards languished  players at dominoes musingly built towers with them  drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine  madame defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick  and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off   thus  saint antoine in this vinous feature of his  until midday  it was high noontide  when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps  of whom  one was monsieur defarge  the other a mender of roads in a blue cap  all adust and athirst  the two entered the wine shop  their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of saint antoine  fast spreading as they came along  which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows  yet  no one had followed them  and no man spoke when they entered the wine shop  though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them    good day  gentlemen   said monsieur defarge   it may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue  it elicited an answering chorus of  good day     it is bad weather  gentlemen   said defarge  shaking his head   upon which  every man looked at his neighbour  and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent  except one man  who got up and went out    my wife   said defarge aloud  addressing madame defarge   i have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads  called jacques  i met him  by accident  a day and half s journey out of paris  he is a good child  this mender of roads  called jacques  give him to drink  my wife    a second man got up and went out  madame defarge set wine before the mender of roads called jacques  who doffed his blue cap to the company  and drank  in the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread  he ate of this between whiles  and sat munching and drinking near madame defarge s counter  a third man got up and went out   defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine  but  he took less than was given to the stranger  as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity  and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast  he looked at no one present  and no one now looked at him  not even madame defarge  who had taken up her knitting  and was at work    have you finished your repast  friend   he asked  in due season    yes  thank you     come  then  you shall see the apartment that i told you you could occupy  it will suit you to a marvel    out of the wine shop into the street  out of the street into a courtyard  out of the courtyard up a steep staircase  out of the staircase into a garret  formerly the garret where a white haired man sat on a low bench  stooping forward and very busy  making shoes   no white haired man was there now  but  the three men were there who had gone out of the wine shop singly  and between them and the white haired man afar off  was the one small link  that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall   defarge closed the door carefully  and spoke in a subdued voice    jacques one  jacques two  jacques three  this is the witness encountered by appointment  by me  jacques four  he will tell you all  speak  jacques five    the mender of roads  blue cap in hand  wiped his swarthy forehead with it  and said   where shall i commence  monsieur     commence   was monsieur defarge s not unreasonable reply   at the commencement     i saw him then  messieurs   began the mender of roads   a year ago this running summer  underneath the carriage of the marquis  hanging by the chain  behold the manner of it  i leaving my work on the road  the sun going to bed  the carriage of the marquis slowly ascending the hill  he hanging by the chain  like this    again the mender of roads went through the whole performance  in which he ought to have been perfect by that time  seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year   jacques one struck in  and asked if he had ever seen the man before    never   answered the mender of roads  recovering his perpendicular   jacques three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then    by his tall figure   said the mender of roads  softly  and with his finger at his nose   when monsieur the marquis demands that evening   say  what is he like   i make response   tall as a spectre      you should have said  short as a dwarf   returned jacques two    but what did i know  the deed was not then accomplished  neither did he confide in me  observe  under those circumstances even  i do not offer my testimony  monsieur the marquis indicates me with his finger  standing near our little fountain  and says   to me  bring that rascal   my faith  messieurs  i offer nothing     he is right there  jacques   murmured defarge  to him who had interrupted   go on     good   said the mender of roads  with an air of mystery   the tall man is lost  and he is sought  how many months  nine  ten  eleven     no matter  the number   said defarge   he is well hidden  but at last he is unluckily found  go on     i am again at work upon the hill side  and the sun is again about to go to bed  i am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below  where it is already dark  when i raise my eyes  and see coming over the hill six soldiers  in the midst of them is a tall man with his arms bound  tied to his sides  like this    with the aid of his indispensable cap  he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips  with cords that were knotted behind him    i stand aside  messieurs  by my heap of stones  to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass  for it is a solitary road  that  where any spectacle is well worth looking at   and at first  as they approach  i see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound  and that they are almost black to my sight  except on the side of the sun going to bed  where they have a red edge  messieurs  also  i see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road  and are on the hill above it  and are like the shadows of giants  also  i see that they are covered with dust  and that the dust moves with them as they come  tramp  tramp  but when they advance quite near to me  i recognise the tall man  and he recognises me  ah  but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hill side once again  as on the evening when he and i first encountered  close to the same spot    he described it as if he were there  and it was evident that he saw it vividly  perhaps he had not seen much in his life    i do not show the soldiers that i recognise the tall man  he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me  we do it  and we know it  with our eyes   come on   says the chief of that company  pointing to the village   bring him fast to his tomb   and they bring him faster  i follow  his arms are swelled because of being bound so tight  his wooden shoes are large and clumsy  and he is lame  because he is lame  and consequently slow  they drive him with their guns  like this    he imitated the action of a man s being impelled forward by the butt ends of muskets    as they descend the hill like madmen running a race  he falls  they laugh and pick him up again  his face is bleeding and covered with dust  but he cannot touch it  thereupon they laugh again  they bring him into the village  all the village runs to look  they take him past the mill  and up to the prison  all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night  and swallow him  like this    he opened his mouth as wide as he could  and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth  observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again  defarge said   go on  jacques     all the village   pursued the mender of roads  on tiptoe and in a low voice   withdraws  all the village whispers by the fountain  all the village sleeps  all the village dreams of that unhappy one  within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag  and never to come out of it  except to perish  in the morning  with my tools upon my shoulder  eating my morsel of black bread as i go  i make a circuit by the prison  on my way to my work  there i see him  high up  behind the bars of a lofty iron cage  bloody and dusty as last night  looking through  he has no hand free  to wave to me  i dare not call to him  he regards me like a dead man    defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another  the looks of all of them were dark  repressed  and revengeful  as they listened to the countryman s story  the manner of all of them  while it was secret  was authoritative too  they had the air of a rough tribunal  jacques one and two sitting on the old pallet bed  each with his chin resting on his hand  and his eyes intent on the road mender  jacques three  equally intent  on one knee behind them  with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose  defarge standing between them and the narrator  whom he had stationed in the light of the window  by turns looking from him to them  and from them to him    go on  jacques   said defarge    he remains up there in his iron cage some days  the village looks at him by stealth  for it is afraid  but it always looks up  from a distance  at the prison on the crag  and in the evening  when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain  all faces are turned towards the prison  formerly  they were turned towards the posting house  now  they are turned towards the prison  they whisper at the fountain  that although condemned to death he will not be executed  they say that petitions have been presented in paris  showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child  they say that a petition has been presented to the king himself  what do i know  it is possible  perhaps yes  perhaps no     listen then  jacques   number one of that name sternly interposed   know that a petition was presented to the king and queen  all here  yourself excepted  saw the king take it  in his carriage in the street  sitting beside the queen  it is defarge whom you see here  who  at the hazard of his life  darted out before the horses  with the petition in his hand     and once again listen  jacques   said the kneeling number three  his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves  with a strikingly greedy air  as if he hungered for something  that was neither food nor drink   the guard  horse and foot  surrounded the petitioner  and struck him blows  you hear     i hear  messieurs     go on then   said defarge    again  on the other hand  they whisper at the fountain   resumed the countryman   that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot  and that he will very certainly be executed  they even whisper that because he has slain monseigneur  and because monseigneur was the father of his tenants  serfs  what you will  he will be executed as a parricide  one old man says at the fountain  that his right hand  armed with the knife  will be burnt off before his face  that  into wounds which will be made in his arms  his breast  and his legs  there will be poured boiling oil  melted lead  hot resin  wax  and sulphur  finally  that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses  that old man says  all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late king  louis fifteen  but how do i know if he lies  i am not a scholar     listen once again then  jacques   said the man with the restless hand and the craving air   the name of that prisoner was damiens  and it was all done in open day  in the open streets of this city of paris  and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done  than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion  who were full of eager attention to the last  to the last  jacques  prolonged until nightfall  when he had lost two legs and an arm  and still breathed  and it was done  why  how old are you     thirty five   said the mender of roads  who looked sixty    it was done when you were more than ten years old  you might have seen it     enough   said defarge  with grim impatience   long live the devil  go on     well  some whisper this  some whisper that  they speak of nothing else  even the fountain appears to fall to that tune  at length  on sunday night when all the village is asleep  come soldiers  winding down from the prison  and their guns ring on the stones of the little street  workmen dig  workmen hammer  soldiers laugh and sing  in the morning  by the fountain  there is raised a gallows forty feet high  poisoning the water    the mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling  and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky    all work is stopped  all assemble there  nobody leads the cows out  the cows are there with the rest  at midday  the roll of drums  soldiers have marched into the prison in the night  and he is in the midst of many soldiers  he is bound as before  and in his mouth there is a gag  tied so  with a tight string  making him look almost as if he laughed   he suggested it  by creasing his face with his two thumbs  from the corners of his mouth to his ears   on the top of the gallows is fixed the knife  blade upwards  with its point in the air  he is hanged there forty feet high  and is left hanging  poisoning the water    they looked at one another  as he used his blue cap to wipe his face  on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle    it is frightful  messieurs  how can the women and the children draw water  who can gossip of an evening  under that shadow  under it  have i said  when i left the village  monday evening as the sun was going to bed  and looked back from the hill  the shadow struck across the church  across the mill  across the prison  seemed to strike across the earth  messieurs  to where the sky rests upon it    the hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three  and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him    that s all  messieurs  i left at sunset  as i had been warned to do   and i walked on  that night and half next day  until i met  as i was warned i should  this comrade  with him  i came on  now riding and now walking  through the rest of yesterday and through last night  and here you see me    after a gloomy silence  the first jacques said   good  you have acted and recounted faithfully  will you wait for us a little  outside the door     very willingly   said the mender of roads  whom defarge escorted to the top of the stairs  and  leaving seated there  returned   the three had risen  and their heads were together when he came back to the garret    how say you  jacques   demanded number one   to be registered     to be registered  as doomed to destruction   returned defarge    magnificent   croaked the man with the craving    the chateau  and all the race   inquired the first    the chateau and all the race   returned defarge   extermination    the hungry man repeated  in a rapturous croak   magnificent   and began gnawing another finger    are you sure   asked jacques two  of defarge   that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register  without doubt it is safe  for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it  but shall we always be able to decipher it  or  i ought to say  will she     jacques   returned defarge  drawing himself up   if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone  she would not lose a word of it  not a syllable of it  knitted  in her own stitches and her own symbols  it will always be as plain to her as the sun  confide in madame defarge  it would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives  to erase himself from existence  than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of madame defarge    there was a murmur of confidence and approval  and then the man who hungered  asked   is this rustic to be sent back soon  i hope so  he is very simple  is he not a little dangerous     he knows nothing   said defarge   at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height  i charge myself with him  let him remain with me  i will take care of him  and set him on his road  he wishes to see the fine world  the king  the queen  and court  let him see them on sunday     what   exclaimed the hungry man  staring   is it a good sign  that he wishes to see royalty and nobility     jacques   said defarge   judiciously show a cat milk  if you wish her to thirst for it  judiciously show a dog his natural prey  if you wish him to bring it down one day    nothing more was said  and the mender of roads  being found already dozing on the topmost stair  was advised to lay himself down on the pallet bed and take some rest  he needed no persuasion  and was soon asleep   worse quarters than defarge s wine shop  could easily have been found in paris for a provincial slave of that degree  saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted  his life was very new and agreeable  but  madame sat all day at her counter  so expressly unconscious of him  and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface  that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her  for  he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next  and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim  she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out   therefore  when sunday came  the mender of roads was not enchanted  though he said he was  to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to versailles  it was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there  in a public conveyance  it was additionally disconcerting yet  to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon  still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the king and queen    you work hard  madame   said a man near her    yes   answered madame defarge   i have a good deal to do     what do you make  madame     many things     for instance      for instance   returned madame defarge  composedly   shrouds    the man moved a little further away  as soon as he could  and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap  feeling it mightily close and oppressive  if he needed a king and queen to restore him  he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand  for  soon the large faced king and the fair faced queen came in their golden coach  attended by the shining bull s eye of their court  a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords  and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes  the mender of roads bathed himself  so much to his temporary intoxication  that he cried long live the king  long live the queen  long live everybody and everything  as if he had never heard of ubiquitous jacques in his time  then  there were gardens  courtyards  terraces  fountains  green banks  more king and queen  more bull s eye  more lords and ladies  more long live they all  until he absolutely wept with sentiment  during the whole of this scene  which lasted some three hours  he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company  and throughout defarge held him by the collar  as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces    bravo   said defarge  clapping him on the back when it was over  like a patron   you are a good boy    the mender of roads was now coming to himself  and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations  but no    you are the fellow we want   said defarge  in his ear   you make these fools believe that it will last for ever  then  they are the more insolent  and it is the nearer ended     hey   cried the mender of roads  reflectively   that s true     these fools know nothing  while they despise your breath  and would stop it for ever and ever  in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs  they only know what your breath tells them  let it deceive them  then  a little longer  it cannot deceive them too much    madame defarge looked superciliously at the client  and nodded in confirmation    as to you   said she   you would shout and shed tears for anything  if it made a show and a noise  say  would you not     truly  madame  i think so  for the moment     if you were shown a great heap of dolls  and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage  you would pick out the richest and gayest  say  would you not     truly yes  madame     yes  and if you were shown a flock of birds  unable to fly  and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage  you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers  would you not     it is true  madame     you have seen both dolls and birds to day   said madame defarge  with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent   now  go home       xvi  still knitting   madame defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of saint antoine  while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness  and through the dust  and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside  slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of monsieur the marquis  now in his grave  listened to the whispering trees  such ample leisure had the stone faces  now  for listening to the trees and to the fountain  that the few village scarecrows who  in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn  strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase  had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered  a rumour just lived in the village  had a faint and bare existence there  as its people had  that when the knife struck home  the faces changed  from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain  also  that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain  they changed again  and bore a cruel look of being avenged  which they would henceforth bear for ever  in the stone face over the great window of the bed chamber where the murder was done  two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose  which everybody recognised  and which nobody had seen of old  and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at monsieur the marquis petrified  a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute  before they all started away among the moss and leaves  like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there   chateau and hut  stone face and dangling figure  the red stain on the stone floor  and the pure water in the village well  thousands of acres of land  a whole province of france  all france itself  lay under the night sky  concentrated into a faint hair breadth line  so does a whole world  with all its greatnesses and littlenesses  lie in a twinkling star  and as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition  so  sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours  every thought and act  every vice and virtue  of every responsible creature on it   the defarges  husband and wife  came lumbering under the starlight  in their public vehicle  to that gate of paris whereunto their journey naturally tended  there was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse  and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry  monsieur defarge alighted  knowing one or two of the soldiery there  and one of the police  the latter he was intimate with  and affectionately embraced   when saint antoine had again enfolded the defarges in his dusky wings  and they  having finally alighted near the saint s boundaries  were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets  madame defarge spoke to her husband    say then  my friend  what did jacques of the police tell thee     very little to night  but all he knows  there is another spy commissioned for our quarter  there may be many more  for all that he can say  but he knows of one     eh well   said madame defarge  raising her eyebrows with a cool business air   it is necessary to register him  how do they call that man     he is english     so much the better  his name     barsad   said defarge  making it french by pronunciation  but  he had been so careful to get it accurately  that he then spelt it with perfect correctness    barsad   repeated madame   good  christian name     john     john barsad   repeated madame  after murmuring it once to herself   good  his appearance  is it known     age  about forty years  height  about five feet nine  black hair  complexion dark  generally  rather handsome visage  eyes dark  face thin  long  and sallow  nose aquiline  but not straight  having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek  expression  therefore  sinister     eh my faith  it is a portrait   said madame  laughing   he shall be registered to morrow    they turned into the wine shop  which was closed  for it was midnight   and where madame defarge immediately took her post at her desk  counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence  examined the stock  went through the entries in the book  made other entries of her own  checked the serving man in every possible way  and finally dismissed him to bed  then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time  and began knotting them up in her handkerchief  in a chain of separate knots  for safe keeping through the night  all this while  defarge  with his pipe in his mouth  walked up and down  complacently admiring  but never interfering  in which condition  indeed  as to the business and his domestic affairs  he walked up and down through life   the night was hot  and the shop  close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood  was ill smelling  monsieur defarge s olfactory sense was by no means delicate  but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted  and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed  he whiffed the compound of scents away  as he put down his smoked out pipe    you are fatigued   said madame  raising her glance as she knotted the money   there are only the usual odours     i am a little tired   her husband acknowledged    you are a little depressed  too   said madame  whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts  but they had had a ray or two for him   oh  the men  the men     but my dear   began defarge    but my dear   repeated madame  nodding firmly   but my dear  you are faint of heart to night  my dear     well  then   said defarge  as if a thought were wrung out of his breast   it is a long time     it is a long time   repeated his wife   and when is it not a long time  vengeance and retribution require a long time  it is the rule     it does not take a long time to strike a man with lightning   said defarge    how long   demanded madame  composedly   does it take to make and store the lightning  tell me    defarge raised his head thoughtfully  as if there were something in that too    it does not take a long time   said madame   for an earthquake to swallow a town  eh well  tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake     a long time  i suppose   said defarge    but when it is ready  it takes place  and grinds to pieces everything before it  in the meantime  it is always preparing  though it is not seen or heard  that is your consolation  keep it    she tied a knot with flashing eyes  as if it throttled a foe    i tell thee   said madame  extending her right hand  for emphasis   that although it is a long time on the road  it is on the road and coming  i tell thee it never retreats  and never stops  i tell thee it is always advancing  look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know  consider the faces of all the world that we know  consider the rage and discontent to which the jacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour  can such things last  bah  i mock you     my brave wife   returned defarge  standing before her with his head a little bent  and his hands clasped at his back  like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist   i do not question all this  but it has lasted a long time  and it is possible  you know well  my wife  it is possible  that it may not come  during our lives     eh well  how then   demanded madame  tying another knot  as if there were another enemy strangled    well   said defarge  with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug   we shall not see the triumph     we shall have helped it   returned madame  with her extended hand in strong action   nothing that we do  is done in vain  i believe  with all my soul  that we shall see the triumph  but even if not  even if i knew certainly not  show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant  and still i would     then madame  with her teeth set  tied a very terrible knot indeed    hold   cried defarge  reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice   i too  my dear  will stop at nothing     yes  but it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity  to sustain you  sustain yourself without that  when the time comes  let loose a tiger and a devil  but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chained  not shown  yet always ready    madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out  and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner  and observing that it was time to go to bed   next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wine shop  knitting away assiduously  a rose lay beside her  and if she now and then glanced at the flower  it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air  there were a few customers  drinking or not drinking  standing or seated  sprinkled about  the day was very hot  and heaps of flies  who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame  fell dead at the bottom  their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading  who looked at them in the coolest manner  as if they themselves were elephants  or something as far removed   until they met the same fate  curious to consider how heedless flies are   perhaps they thought as much at court that sunny summer day   a figure entering at the door threw a shadow on madame defarge which she felt to be a new one  she laid down her knitting  and began to pin her rose in her head dress  before she looked at the figure   it was curious  the moment madame defarge took up the rose  the customers ceased talking  and began gradually to drop out of the wine shop    good day  madame   said the new comer    good day  monsieur    she said it aloud  but added to herself  as she resumed her knitting   hah  good day  age about forty  height about five feet nine  black hair  generally rather handsome visage  complexion dark  eyes dark  thin  long and sallow face  aquiline nose but not straight  having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression  good day  one and all     have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac  and a mouthful of cool fresh water  madame    madame complied with a polite air    marvellous cognac this  madame    it was the first time it had ever been so complimented  and madame defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better  she said  however  that the cognac was flattered  and took up her knitting  the visitor watched her fingers for a few moments  and took the opportunity of observing the place in general    you knit with great skill  madame     i am accustomed to it     a pretty pattern too     you think so   said madame  looking at him with a smile    decidedly  may one ask what it is for     pastime   said madame  still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly    not for use     that depends  i may find a use for it one day  if i do  well   said madame  drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry   i ll use it    it was remarkable  but  the taste of saint antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head dress of madame defarge  two men had entered separately  and had been about to order drink  when  catching sight of that novelty  they faltered  made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there  and went away  nor  of those who had been there when this visitor entered  was there one left  they had all dropped off  the spy had kept his eyes open  but had been able to detect no sign  they had lounged away in a poverty stricken  purposeless  accidental manner  quite natural and unimpeachable    john   thought madame  checking off her work as her fingers knitted  and her eyes looked at the stranger   stay long enough  and i shall knit  barsad  before you go     you have a husband  madame     i have     children     no children     business seems bad     business is very bad  the people are so poor     ah  the unfortunate  miserable people  so oppressed  too  as you say     as you say   madame retorted  correcting him  and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good    pardon me  certainly it was i who said so  but you naturally think so  of course     i think   returned madame  in a high voice   i and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine shop open  without thinking  all we think  here  is how to live  that is the subject we think of  and it gives us  from morning to night  enough to think about  without embarrassing our heads concerning others  i think for others  no  no    the spy  who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make  did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face  but  stood with an air of gossiping gallantry  leaning his elbow on madame defarge s little counter  and occasionally sipping his cognac    a bad business this  madame  of gaspard s execution  ah  the poor gaspard   with a sigh of great compassion    my faith   returned madame  coolly and lightly   if people use knives for such purposes  they have to pay for it  he knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was  he has paid the price     i believe   said the spy  dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence  and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face   i believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood  touching the poor fellow  between ourselves     is there   asked madame  vacantly    is there not       here is my husband   said madame defarge   as the keeper of the wine shop entered at the door  the spy saluted him by touching his hat  and saying  with an engaging smile   good day  jacques   defarge stopped short  and stared at him    good day  jacques   the spy repeated  with not quite so much confidence  or quite so easy a smile under the stare    you deceive yourself  monsieur   returned the keeper of the wine shop   you mistake me for another  that is not my name  i am ernest defarge     it is all the same   said the spy  airily  but discomfited too   good day     good day   answered defarge  drily    i was saying to madame  with whom i had the pleasure of chatting when you entered  that they tell me there is  and no wonder   much sympathy and anger in saint antoine  touching the unhappy fate of poor gaspard     no one has told me so   said defarge  shaking his head   i know nothing of it    having said it  he passed behind the little counter  and stood with his hand on the back of his wife s chair  looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed  and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction   the spy  well used to his business  did not change his unconscious attitude  but drained his little glass of cognac  took a sip of fresh water  and asked for another glass of cognac  madame defarge poured it out for him  took to her knitting again  and hummed a little song over it    you seem to know this quarter well  that is to say  better than i do    observed defarge    not at all  but i hope to know it better  i am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants     hah   muttered defarge    the pleasure of conversing with you  monsieur defarge  recalls to me    pursued the spy   that i have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name     indeed   said defarge  with much indifference    yes  indeed  when doctor manette was released  you  his old domestic  had the charge of him  i know  he was delivered to you  you see i am informed of the circumstances     such is the fact  certainly   said defarge  he had had it conveyed to him  in an accidental touch of his wife s elbow as she knitted and warbled  that he would do best to answer  but always with brevity    it was to you   said the spy   that his daughter came  and it was from your care that his daughter took him  accompanied by a neat brown monsieur  how is he called   in a little wig  lorry  of the bank of tellson and company  over to england     such is the fact   repeated defarge    very interesting remembrances   said the spy   i have known doctor manette and his daughter  in england     yes   said defarge    you don t hear much about them now   said the spy    no   said defarge    in effect   madame struck in  looking up from her work and her little song   we never hear about them  we received the news of their safe arrival  and perhaps another letter  or perhaps two  but  since then  they have gradually taken their road in life  we  ours  and we have held no correspondence     perfectly so  madame   replied the spy   she is going to be married     going   echoed madame   she was pretty enough to have been married long ago  you english are cold  it seems to me     oh  you know i am english     i perceive your tongue is   returned madame   and what the tongue is  i suppose the man is    he did not take the identification as a compliment  but he made the best of it  and turned it off with a laugh  after sipping his cognac to the end  he added    yes  miss manette is going to be married  but not to an englishman  to one who  like herself  is french by birth  and speaking of gaspard  ah  poor gaspard  it was cruel  cruel    it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of monsieur the marquis  for whom gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet  in other words  the present marquis  but he lives unknown in england  he is no marquis there  he is mr  charles darnay  d aulnais is the name of his mother s family    madame defarge knitted steadily  but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband  do what he would  behind the little counter  as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe  he was troubled  and his hand was not trustworthy  the spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it  or to record it in his mind   having made  at least  this one hit  whatever it might prove to be worth  and no customers coming in to help him to any other  mr  barsad paid for what he had drunk  and took his leave  taking occasion to say  in a genteel manner  before he departed  that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame defarge again  for some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of saint antoine  the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them  lest he should come back    can it be true   said defarge  in a low voice  looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair   what he has said of ma amselle manette     as he has said it   returned madame  lifting her eyebrows a little   it is probably false  but it may be true     if it is    defarge began  and stopped    if it is   repeated his wife      and if it does come  while we live to see it triumph  i hope  for her sake  destiny will keep her husband out of france     her husband s destiny   said madame defarge  with her usual composure   will take him where he is to go  and will lead him to the end that is to end him  that is all i know     but it is very strange  now  at least  is it not very strange   said defarge  rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it   that  after all our sympathy for monsieur her father  and herself  her husband s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment  by the side of that infernal dog s who has just left us     stranger things than that will happen when it does come   answered madame   i have them both here  of a certainty  and they are both here for their merits  that is enough    she rolled up her knitting when she had said those words  and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head  either saint antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone  or saint antoine was on the watch for its disappearance  howbeit  the saint took courage to lounge in  very shortly afterwards  and the wine shop recovered its habitual aspect   in the evening  at which season of all others saint antoine turned himself inside out  and sat on door steps and window ledges  and came to the corners of vile streets and courts  for a breath of air  madame defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group  a missionary  there were many like her  such as the world will do well never to breed again  all the women knitted  they knitted worthless things  but  the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking  the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus  if the bony fingers had been still  the stomachs would have been more famine pinched   but  as the fingers went  the eyes went  and the thoughts  and as madame defarge moved on from group to group  all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with  and left behind   her husband smoked at his door  looking after her with admiration   a great woman   said he   a strong woman  a grand woman  a frightfully grand woman    darkness closed around  and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the palace courtyard  as the women sat knitting  knitting  darkness encompassed them  another darkness was closing in as surely  when the church bells  then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over france  should be melted into thundering cannon  when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice  that night all potent as the voice of power and plenty  freedom and life  so much was closing in about the women who sat knitting  knitting  that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt  where they were to sit knitting  knitting  counting dropping heads      xvii  one night   never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in soho  than one memorable evening when the doctor and his daughter sat under the plane tree together  never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great london  than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree  and shone upon their faces through its leaves   lucie was to be married to morrow  she had reserved this last evening for her father  and they sat alone under the plane tree    you are happy  my dear father     quite  my child    they had said little  though they had been there a long time  when it was yet light enough to work and read  she had neither engaged herself in her usual work  nor had she read to him  she had employed herself in both ways  at his side under the tree  many and many a time  but  this time was not quite like any other  and nothing could make it so    and i am very happy to night  dear father  i am deeply happy in the love that heaven has so blessed  my love for charles  and charles s love for me  but  if my life were not to be still consecrated to you  or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us  even by the length of a few of these streets  i should be more unhappy and self reproachful now than i can tell you  even as it is     even as it was  she could not command her voice   in the sad moonlight  she clasped him by the neck  and laid her face upon his breast  in the moonlight which is always sad  as the light of the sun itself is  as the light called human life is  at its coming and its going    dearest dear  can you tell me  this last time  that you feel quite  quite sure  no new affections of mine  and no new duties of mine  will ever interpose between us  i know it well  but do you know it  in your own heart  do you feel quite certain    her father answered  with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed   quite sure  my darling  more than that   he added  as he tenderly kissed her   my future is far brighter  lucie  seen through your marriage  than it could have been  nay  than it ever was  without it     if i could hope that  my father       believe it  love  indeed it is so  consider how natural and how plain it is  my dear  that it should be so  you  devoted and young  cannot fully appreciate the anxiety i have felt that your life should not be wasted     she moved her hand towards his lips  but he took it in his  and repeated the word      wasted  my child  should not be wasted  struck aside from the natural order of things  for my sake  your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this  but  only ask yourself  how could my happiness be perfect  while yours was incomplete     if i had never seen charles  my father  i should have been quite happy with you    he smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without charles  having seen him  and replied    my child  you did see him  and it is charles  if it had not been charles  it would have been another  or  if it had been no other  i should have been the cause  and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself  and would have fallen on you    it was the first time  except at the trial  of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering  it gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears  and she remembered it long afterwards    see   said the doctor of beauvais  raising his hand towards the moon   i have looked at her from my prison window  when i could not bear her light  i have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what i had lost  that i have beaten my head against my prison walls  i have looked at her  in a state so dull and lethargic  that i have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines i could draw across her at the full  and the number of perpendicular lines with which i could intersect them   he added in his inward and pondering manner  as he looked at the moon   it was twenty either way  i remember  and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in    the strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time  deepened as he dwelt upon it  but  there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference  he only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over    i have looked at her  speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom i had been rent  whether it was alive  whether it had been born alive  or the poor mother s shock had killed it  whether it was a son who would some day avenge his father   there was a time in my imprisonment  when my desire for vengeance was unbearable   whether it was a son who would never know his father s story  who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father s having disappeared of his own will and act  whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman    she drew closer to him  and kissed his cheek and his hand    i have pictured my daughter  to myself  as perfectly forgetful of me  rather  altogether ignorant of me  and unconscious of me  i have cast up the years of her age  year after year  i have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate  i have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living  and in the next generation my place was a blank     my father  even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed  strikes to my heart as if i had been that child     you  lucie  it is out of the consolation and restoration you have brought to me  that these remembrances arise  and pass between us and the moon on this last night   what did i say just now     she knew nothing of you  she cared nothing for you     so  but on other moonlight nights  when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way  have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace  as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could  i have imagined her as coming to me in my cell  and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress  i have seen her image in the moonlight often  as i now see you  except that i never held her in my arms  it stood between the little grated window and the door  but  you understand that that was not the child i am speaking of     the figure was not  the  the  image  the fancy     no  that was another thing  it stood before my disturbed sense of sight  but it never moved  the phantom that my mind pursued  was another and more real child  of her outward appearance i know no more than that she was like her mother  the other had that likeness too  as you have  but was not the same  can you follow me  lucie  hardly  i think  i doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions    his collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold  as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition    in that more peaceful state  i have imagined her  in the moonlight  coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father  my picture was in her room  and i was in her prayers  her life was active  cheerful  useful  but my poor history pervaded it all     i was that child  my father  i was not half so good  but in my love that was i     and she showed me her children   said the doctor of beauvais   and they had heard of me  and had been taught to pity me  when they passed a prison of the state  they kept far from its frowning walls  and looked up at its bars  and spoke in whispers  she could never deliver me  i imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things  but then  blessed with the relief of tears  i fell upon my knees  and blessed her     i am that child  i hope  my father  o my dear  my dear  will you bless me as fervently to morrow     lucie  i recall these old troubles in the reason that i have to night for loving you better than words can tell  and thanking god for my great happiness  my thoughts  when they were wildest  never rose near the happiness that i have known with you  and that we have before us    he embraced her  solemnly commended her to heaven  and humbly thanked heaven for having bestowed her on him  by and bye  they went into the house   there was no one bidden to the marriage but mr  lorry  there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross  the marriage was to make no change in their place of residence  they had been able to extend it  by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger  and they desired nothing more   doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper  they were only three at table  and miss pross made the third  he regretted that charles was not there  was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away  and drank to him affectionately   so  the time came for him to bid lucie good night  and they separated  but  in the stillness of the third hour of the morning  lucie came downstairs again  and stole into his room  not free from unshaped fears  beforehand   all things  however  were in their places  all was quiet  and he lay asleep  his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow  and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet  she put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance  crept up to his bed  and put her lips to his  then  leaned over him  and looked at him   into his handsome face  the bitter waters of captivity had worn  but  he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong  that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep  a more remarkable face in its quiet  resolute  and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant  was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep  that night   she timidly laid her hand on his dear breast  and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be  and as his sorrows deserved  then  she withdrew her hand  and kissed his lips once more  and went away  so  the sunrise came  and the shadows of the leaves of the plane tree moved upon his face  as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him      xviii  nine days   the marriage day was shining brightly  and they were ready outside the closed door of the doctor s room  where he was speaking with charles darnay  they were ready to go to church  the beautiful bride  mr  lorry  and miss pross  to whom the event  through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable  would have been one of absolute bliss  but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother solomon should have been the bridegroom    and so   said mr  lorry  who could not sufficiently admire the bride  and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet  pretty dress   and so it was for this  my sweet lucie  that i brought you across the channel  such a baby  lord bless me  how little i thought what i was doing  how lightly i valued the obligation i was conferring on my friend mr  charles     you didn t mean it   remarked the matter of fact miss pross   and therefore how could you know it  nonsense     really  well  but don t cry   said the gentle mr  lorry    i am not crying   said miss pross   you are     i  my pross    by this time  mr  lorry dared to be pleasant with her  on occasion     you were  just now  i saw you do it  and i don t wonder at it  such a present of plate as you have made  em  is enough to bring tears into anybody s eyes  there s not a fork or a spoon in the collection   said miss pross   that i didn t cry over  last night after the box came  till i couldn t see it     i am highly gratified   said mr  lorry   though  upon my honour  i had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one  dear me  this is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost  dear  dear  dear  to think that there might have been a mrs  lorry  any time these fifty years almost     not at all   from miss pross    you think there never might have been a mrs  lorry   asked the gentleman of that name    pooh   rejoined miss pross   you were a bachelor in your cradle     well   observed mr  lorry  beamingly adjusting his little wig   that seems probable  too     and you were cut out for a bachelor   pursued miss pross   before you were put in your cradle     then  i think   said mr  lorry   that i was very unhandsomely dealt with  and that i ought to have had a voice in the selection of my pattern  enough  now  my dear lucie   drawing his arm soothingly round her waist   i hear them moving in the next room  and miss pross and i  as two formal folks of business  are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear  you leave your good father  my dear  in hands as earnest and as loving as your own  he shall be taken every conceivable care of  during the next fortnight  while you are in warwickshire and thereabouts  even tellson s shall go to the wall  comparatively speaking  before him  and when  at the fortnight s end  he comes to join you and your beloved husband  on your other fortnight s trip in wales  you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame  now  i hear somebody s step coming to the door  let me kiss my dear girl with an old fashioned bachelor blessing  before somebody comes to claim his own    for a moment  he held the fair face from him to look at the well remembered expression on the forehead  and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig  with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which  if such things be old fashioned  were as old as adam   the door of the doctor s room opened  and he came out with charles darnay  he was so deadly pale  which had not been the case when they went in together  that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face  but  in the composure of his manner he was unaltered  except that to the shrewd glance of mr  lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him  like a cold wind   he gave his arm to his daughter  and took her down stairs to the chariot which mr  lorry had hired in honour of the day  the rest followed in another carriage  and soon  in a neighbouring church  where no strange eyes looked on  charles darnay and lucie manette were happily married   besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done  some diamonds  very bright and sparkling  glanced on the bride s hand  which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of mr  lorry s pockets  they returned home to breakfast  and all went well  and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker s white locks in the paris garret  were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight  on the threshold of the door at parting   it was a hard parting  though it was not for long  but her father cheered her  and said at last  gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms   take her  charles  she is yours    and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window  and she was gone   the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious  and the preparations having been very simple and few  the doctor  mr  lorry  and miss pross  were left quite alone  it was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall  that mr  lorry observed a great change to have come over the doctor  as if the golden arm uplifted there  had struck him a poisoned blow   he had naturally repressed much  and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone  but  it was the old scared lost look that troubled mr  lorry  and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up stairs  mr  lorry was reminded of defarge the wine shop keeper  and the starlight ride    i think   he whispered to miss pross  after anxious consideration   i think we had best not speak to him just now  or at all disturb him  i must look in at tellson s  so i will go there at once and come back presently  then  we will take him a ride into the country  and dine there  and all will be well    it was easier for mr  lorry to look in at tellson s  than to look out of tellson s  he was detained two hours  when he came back  he ascended the old staircase alone  having asked no question of the servant  going thus into the doctor s rooms  he was stopped by a low sound of knocking    good god   he said  with a start   what s that    miss pross  with a terrified face  was at his ear   o me  o me  all is lost   cried she  wringing her hands   what is to be told to ladybird  he doesn t know me  and is making shoes    mr  lorry said what he could to calm her  and went himself into the doctor s room  the bench was turned towards the light  as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before  and his head was bent down  and he was very busy    doctor manette  my dear friend  doctor manette    the doctor looked at him for a moment  half inquiringly  half as if he were angry at being spoken to  and bent over his work again   he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat  his shirt was open at the throat  as it used to be when he did that work  and even the old haggard  faded surface of face had come back to him  he worked hard  impatiently  as if in some sense of having been interrupted   mr  lorry glanced at the work in his hand  and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape  he took up another that was lying by him  and asked what it was    a young lady s walking shoe   he muttered  without looking up   it ought to have been finished long ago  let it be     but  doctor manette  look at me    he obeyed  in the old mechanically submissive manner  without pausing in his work    you know me  my dear friend  think again  this is not your proper occupation  think  dear friend    nothing would induce him to speak more  he looked up  for an instant at a time  when he was requested to do so  but  no persuasion would extract a word from him  he worked  and worked  and worked  in silence  and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall  or on the air  the only ray of hope that mr  lorry could discover  was  that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked  in that  there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity  as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind   two things at once impressed themselves on mr  lorry  as important above all others  the first  that this must be kept secret from lucie  the second  that it must be kept secret from all who knew him  in conjunction with miss pross  he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution  by giving out that the doctor was not well  and required a few days of complete rest  in aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter  miss pross was to write  describing his having been called away professionally  and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand  represented to have been addressed to her by the same post   these measures  advisable to be taken in any case  mr  lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself  if that should happen soon  he kept another course in reserve  which was  to have a certain opinion that he thought the best  on the doctor s case   in the hope of his recovery  and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable  mr  lorry resolved to watch him attentively  with as little appearance as possible of doing so  he therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellson s for the first time in his life  and took his post by the window in the same room   he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him  since  on being pressed  he became worried  he abandoned that attempt on the first day  and resolved merely to keep himself always before him  as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen  or was falling  he remained  therefore  in his seat near the window  reading and writing  and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of  that it was a free place   doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink  and worked on  that first day  until it was too dark to see  worked on  half an hour after mr  lorry could not have seen  for his life  to read or write  when he put his tools aside as useless  until morning  mr  lorry rose and said to him    will you go out    he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner  looked up in the old manner  and repeated in the old low voice    out     yes  for a walk with me  why not    he made no effort to say why not  and said not a word more  but  mr  lorry thought he saw  as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk  with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands  that he was in some misty way asking himself   why not   the sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here  and determined to hold it   miss pross and he divided the night into two watches  and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room  he paced up and down for a long time before he lay down  but  when he did finally lay himself down  he fell asleep  in the morning  he was up betimes  and went straight to his bench and to work   on this second day  mr  lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name  and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them  he returned no reply  but it was evident that he heard what was said  and that he thought about it  however confusedly  this encouraged mr  lorry to have miss pross in with her work  several times during the day  at those times  they quietly spoke of lucie  and of her father then present  precisely in the usual manner  and as if there were nothing amiss  this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment  not long enough  or often enough to harass him  and it lightened mr  lorry s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener  and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him   when it fell dark again  mr  lorry asked him as before    dear doctor  will you go out    as before  he repeated   out     yes  for a walk with me  why not    this time  mr  lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him  and  after remaining absent for an hour  returned  in the meanwhile  the doctor had removed to the seat in the window  and had sat there looking down at the plane tree  but  on mr  lorry s return  he slipped away to his bench   the time went very slowly on  and mr  lorry s hope darkened  and his heart grew heavier again  and grew yet heavier and heavier every day  the third day came and went  the fourth  the fifth  five days  six days  seven days  eight days  nine days   with a hope ever darkening  and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier  mr  lorry passed through this anxious time  the secret was well kept  and lucie was unconscious and happy  but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker  whose hand had been a little out at first  was growing dreadfully skilful  and that he had never been so intent on his work  and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert  as in the dusk of the ninth evening      xix  an opinion   worn out by anxious watching  mr  lorry fell asleep at his post  on the tenth morning of his suspense  he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night   he rubbed his eyes and roused himself  but he doubted  when he had done so  whether he was not still asleep  for  going to the door of the doctor s room and looking in  he perceived that the shoemaker s bench and tools were put aside again  and that the doctor himself sat reading at the window  he was in his usual morning dress  and his face  which mr  lorry could distinctly see   though still very pale  was calmly studious and attentive   even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake  mr  lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own  for  did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect  and employed as usual  and was there any sign within their range  that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened   it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment  the answer being obvious  if the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause  how came he  jarvis lorry  there  how came he to have fallen asleep  in his clothes  on the sofa in doctor manette s consulting room  and to be debating these points outside the doctor s bedroom door in the early morning   within a few minutes  miss pross stood whispering at his side  if he had had any particle of doubt left  her talk would of necessity have resolved it  but he was by that time clear headed  and had none  he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast hour  and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred  if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind  mr  lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been  in his anxiety  so anxious to obtain   miss pross  submitting herself to his judgment  the scheme was worked out with care  having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette  mr  lorry presented himself at the breakfast hour in his usual white linen  and with his usual neat leg  the doctor was summoned in the usual way  and came to breakfast   so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which mr  lorry felt to be the only safe advance  he at first supposed that his daughter s marriage had taken place yesterday  an incidental allusion  purposely thrown out  to the day of the week  and the day of the month  set him thinking and counting  and evidently made him uneasy  in all other respects  however  he was so composedly himself  that mr  lorry determined to have the aid he sought  and that aid was his own   therefore  when the breakfast was done and cleared away  and he and the doctor were left together  mr  lorry said  feelingly    my dear manette  i am anxious to have your opinion  in confidence  on a very curious case in which i am deeply interested  that is to say  it is very curious to me  perhaps  to your better information it may be less so    glancing at his hands  which were discoloured by his late work  the doctor looked troubled  and listened attentively  he had already glanced at his hands more than once    doctor manette   said mr  lorry  touching him affectionately on the arm   the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine  pray give your mind to it  and advise me well for his sake  and above all  for his daughter s  his daughter s  my dear manette     if i understand   said the doctor  in a subdued tone   some mental shock       yes     be explicit   said the doctor   spare no detail    mr  lorry saw that they understood one another  and proceeded    my dear manette  it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock  of great acuteness and severity to the affections  the feelings  the  the  as you express it  the mind  the mind  it is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down  one cannot say for how long  because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself  and there are no other means of getting at it  it is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered  by a process that he cannot trace himself  as i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner  it is the case of a shock from which he has recovered  so completely  as to be a highly intelligent man  capable of close application of mind  and great exertion of body  and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge  which was already very large  but  unfortunately  there has been   he paused and took a deep breath   a slight relapse    the doctor  in a low voice  asked   of how long duration     nine days and nights     how did it show itself  i infer   glancing at his hands again   in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock     that is the fact     now  did you ever see him   asked the doctor  distinctly and collectedly  though in the same low voice   engaged in that pursuit originally     once     and when the relapse fell on him  was he in most respects  or in all respects  as he was then     i think in all respects     you spoke of his daughter  does his daughter know of the relapse     no  it has been kept from her  and i hope will always be kept from her  it is known only to myself  and to one other who may be trusted    the doctor grasped his hand  and murmured   that was very kind  that was very thoughtful   mr  lorry grasped his hand in return  and neither of the two spoke for a little while    now  my dear manette   said mr  lorry  at length  in his most considerate and most affectionate way   i am a mere man of business  and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters  i do not possess the kind of information necessary  i do not possess the kind of intelligence  i want guiding  there is no man in this world on whom i could so rely for right guidance  as on you  tell me  how does this relapse come about  is there danger of another  could a repetition of it be prevented  how should a repetition of it be treated  how does it come about at all  what can i do for my friend  no man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend  than i am to serve mine  if i knew how    but i don t know how to originate  in such a case  if your sagacity  knowledge  and experience  could put me on the right track  i might be able to do so much  unenlightened and undirected  i can do so little  pray discuss it with me  pray enable me to see it a little more clearly  and teach me how to be a little more useful    doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken  and mr  lorry did not press him    i think it probable   said the doctor  breaking silence with an effort   that the relapse you have described  my dear friend  was not quite unforeseen by its subject     was it dreaded by him   mr  lorry ventured to ask    very much   he said it with an involuntary shudder    you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer s mind  and how difficult  how almost impossible  it is  for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him     would he   asked mr  lorry   be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one  when it is on him     i think so  but it is  as i have told you  next to impossible  i even believe it  in some cases  to be quite impossible     now   said mr  lorry  gently laying his hand on the doctor s arm again  after a short silence on both sides   to what would you refer this attack     i believe   returned doctor manette   that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady  some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled  i think  it is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind  that those associations would be recalled  say  under certain circumstances  say  on a particular occasion  he tried to prepare himself in vain  perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it     would he remember what took place in the relapse   asked mr  lorry  with natural hesitation   the doctor looked desolately round the room  shook his head  and answered  in a low voice   not at all     now  as to the future   hinted mr  lorry    as to the future   said the doctor  recovering firmness   i should have great hope  as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon  i should have great hope  he  yielding under the pressure of a complicated something  long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against  and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed  i should hope that the worst was over     well  well  that s good comfort  i am thankful   said mr  lorry    i am thankful   repeated the doctor  bending his head with reverence    there are two other points   said mr  lorry   on which i am anxious to be instructed  i may go on     you cannot do your friend a better service   the doctor gave him his hand    to the first  then  he is of a studious habit  and unusually energetic  he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge  to the conducting of experiments  to many things  now  does he do too much     i think not  it may be the character of his mind  to be always in singular need of occupation  that may be  in part  natural to it  in part  the result of affliction  the less it was occupied with healthy things  the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction  he may have observed himself  and made the discovery     you are sure that he is not under too great a strain     i think i am quite sure of it     my dear manette  if he were overworked now      my dear lorry  i doubt if that could easily be  there has been a violent stress in one direction  and it needs a counterweight     excuse me  as a persistent man of business  assuming for a moment  that he was overworked  it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder     i do not think so  i do not think   said doctor manette with the firmness of self conviction   that anything but the one train of association would renew it  i think that  henceforth  nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it  after what has happened  and after his recovery  i find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again  i trust  and i almost believe  that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted    he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind  and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress  it was not for his friend to abate that confidence  he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was  and approached his second and last point  he felt it to be the most difficult of all  but  remembering his old sunday morning conversation with miss pross  and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days  he knew that he must face it    the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from   said mr  lorry  clearing his throat   we will call  blacksmith s work  blacksmith s work  we will say  to put a case and for the sake of illustration  that he had been used  in his bad time  to work at a little forge  we will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again  is it not a pity that he should keep it by him    the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand  and beat his foot nervously on the ground    he has always kept it by him   said mr  lorry  with an anxious look at his friend   now  would it not be better that he should let it go    still  the doctor  with shaded forehead  beat his foot nervously on the ground    you do not find it easy to advise me   said mr  lorry   i quite understand it to be a nice question  and yet i think    and there he shook his head  and stopped    you see   said doctor manette  turning to him after an uneasy pause   it is very hard to explain  consistently  the innermost workings of this poor man s mind  he once yearned so frightfully for that occupation  and it was so welcome when it came  no doubt it relieved his pain so much  by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain  and by substituting  as he became more practised  the ingenuity of the hands  for the ingenuity of the mental torture  that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach  even now  when i believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been  and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence  the idea that he might need that old employment  and not find it  gives him a sudden sense of terror  like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child    he looked like his illustration  as he raised his eyes to mr  lorry s face    but may not  mind  i ask for information  as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas  shillings  and bank notes  may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea  if the thing were gone  my dear manette  might not the fear go with it  in short  is it not a concession to the misgiving  to keep the forge    there was another silence    you see  too   said the doctor  tremulously   it is such an old companion     i would not keep it   said mr  lorry  shaking his head  for he gained in firmness as he saw the doctor disquieted   i would recommend him to sacrifice it  i only want your authority  i am sure it does no good  come  give me your authority  like a dear good man  for his daughter s sake  my dear manette    very strange to see what a struggle there was within him    in her name  then  let it be done  i sanction it  but  i would not take it away while he was present  let it be removed when he is not there  let him miss his old companion after an absence    mr  lorry readily engaged for that  and the conference was ended  they passed the day in the country  and the doctor was quite restored  on the three following days he remained perfectly well  and on the fourteenth day he went away to join lucie and her husband  the precaution that had been taken to account for his silence  mr  lorry had previously explained to him  and he had written to lucie in accordance with it  and she had no suspicions   on the night of the day on which he left the house  mr  lorry went into his room with a chopper  saw  chisel  and hammer  attended by miss pross carrying a light  there  with closed doors  and in a mysterious and guilty manner  mr  lorry hacked the shoemaker s bench to pieces  while miss pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder  for which  indeed  in her grimness  she was no unsuitable figure  the burning of the body  previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose  was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire  and the tools  shoes  and leather  were buried in the garden  so wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds  that mr  lorry and miss pross  while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces  almost felt  and almost looked  like accomplices in a horrible crime      xx  a plea   when the newly married pair came home  the first person who appeared  to offer his congratulations  was sydney carton  they had not been at home many hours  when he presented himself  he was not improved in habits  or in looks  or in manner  but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him  which was new to the observation of charles darnay   he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window  and of speaking to him when no one overheard    mr  darnay   said carton   i wish we might be friends     we are already friends  i hope     you are good enough to say so  as a fashion of speech  but  i don t mean any fashion of speech  indeed  when i say i wish we might be friends  i scarcely mean quite that  either    charles darnay  as was natural  asked him  in all good humour and good fellowship  what he did mean    upon my life   said carton  smiling   i find that easier to comprehend in my own mind  than to convey to yours  however  let me try  you remember a certain famous occasion when i was more drunk than  than usual     i remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking     i remember it too  the curse of those occasions is heavy upon me  for i always remember them  i hope it may be taken into account one day  when all days are at an end for me  don t be alarmed  i am not going to preach     i am not at all alarmed  earnestness in you  is anything but alarming to me     ah   said carton  with a careless wave of his hand  as if he waved that away   on the drunken occasion in question  one of a large number  as you know   i was insufferable about liking you  and not liking you  i wish you would forget it     i forgot it long ago     fashion of speech again  but  mr  darnay  oblivion is not so easy to me  as you represent it to be to you  i have by no means forgotten it  and a light answer does not help me to forget it     if it was a light answer   returned darnay   i beg your forgiveness for it  i had no other object than to turn a slight thing  which  to my surprise  seems to trouble you too much  aside  i declare to you  on the faith of a gentleman  that i have long dismissed it from my mind  good heaven  what was there to dismiss  have i had nothing more important to remember  in the great service you rendered me that day     as to the great service   said carton   i am bound to avow to you  when you speak of it in that way  that it was mere professional claptrap  i don t know that i cared what became of you  when i rendered it   mind  i say when i rendered it  i am speaking of the past     you make light of the obligation   returned darnay   but i will not quarrel with your light answer     genuine truth  mr  darnay  trust me  i have gone aside from my purpose  i was speaking about our being friends  now  you know me  you know i am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men  if you doubt it  ask stryver  and he ll tell you so     i prefer to form my own opinion  without the aid of his     well  at any rate you know me as a dissolute dog  who has never done any good  and never will     i don t know that you  never will      but i do  and you must take my word for it  well  if you could endure to have such a worthless fellow  and a fellow of such indifferent reputation  coming and going at odd times  i should ask that i might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here  that i might be regarded as an useless  and i would add  if it were not for the resemblance i detected between you and me  an unornamental  piece of furniture  tolerated for its old service  and taken no notice of  i doubt if i should abuse the permission  it is a hundred to one if i should avail myself of it four times in a year  it would satisfy me  i dare say  to know that i had it     will you try     that is another way of saying that i am placed on the footing i have indicated  i thank you  darnay  i may use that freedom with your name     i think so  carton  by this time    they shook hands upon it  and sydney turned away  within a minute afterwards  he was  to all outward appearance  as unsubstantial as ever   when he was gone  and in the course of an evening passed with miss pross  the doctor  and mr  lorry  charles darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms  and spoke of sydney carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness  he spoke of him  in short  not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him  but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself   he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife  but  when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms  he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked    we are thoughtful to night   said darnay  drawing his arm about her    yes  dearest charles   with her hands on his breast  and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him   we are rather thoughtful to night  for we have something on our mind to night     what is it  my lucie     will you promise not to press one question on me  if i beg you not to ask it     will i promise  what will i not promise to my love    what  indeed  with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek  and his other hand against the heart that beat for him    i think  charles  poor mr  carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to night     indeed  my own  why so     that is what you are not to ask me  but i think  i know  he does     if you know it  it is enough  what would you have me do  my life     i would ask you  dearest  to be very generous with him always  and very lenient on his faults when he is not by  i would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very  very seldom reveals  and that there are deep wounds in it  my dear  i have seen it bleeding     it is a painful reflection to me   said charles darnay  quite astounded   that i should have done him any wrong  i never thought this of him     my husband  it is so  i fear he is not to be reclaimed  there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now  but  i am sure that he is capable of good things  gentle things  even magnanimous things    she looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man  that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours    and  o my dearest love   she urged  clinging nearer to him  laying her head upon his breast  and raising her eyes to his   remember how strong we are in our happiness  and how weak he is in his misery    the supplication touched him home   i will always remember it  dear heart  i will remember it as long as i live    he bent over the golden head  and put the rosy lips to his  and folded her in his arms  if one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets  could have heard her innocent disclosure  and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband  he might have cried to the night  and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time     god bless her for her sweet compassion       xxi  echoing footsteps   a wonderful corner for echoes  it has been remarked  that corner where the doctor lived  ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband  and her father  and herself  and her old directress and companion  in a life of quiet bliss  lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner  listening to the echoing footsteps of years   at first  there were times  though she was a perfectly happy young wife  when her work would slowly fall from her hands  and her eyes would be dimmed  for  there was something coming in the echoes  something light  afar off  and scarcely audible yet  that stirred her heart too much  fluttering hopes and doubts  hopes  of a love as yet unknown to her  doubts  of her remaining upon earth  to enjoy that new delight  divided her breast  among the echoes then  there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave  and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate  and who would mourn for her so much  swelled to her eyes  and broke like waves   that time passed  and her little lucie lay on her bosom  then  among the advancing echoes  there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words  let greater echoes resound as they would  the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming  they came  and the shady house was sunny with a child s laugh  and the divine friend of children  to whom in her trouble she had confided hers  seemed to take her child in his arms  as he took the child of old  and made it a sacred joy to her   ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together  weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives  and making it predominate nowhere  lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds  her husband s step was strong and prosperous among them  her father s firm and equal  lo  miss pross  in harness of string  awakening the echoes  as an unruly charger  whip corrected  snorting and pawing the earth under the plane tree in the garden   even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest  they were not harsh nor cruel  even when golden hair  like her own  lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy  and he said  with a radiant smile   dear papa and mamma  i am very sorry to leave you both  and to leave my pretty sister  but i am called  and i must go   those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother s cheek  as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it  suffer them and forbid them not  they see my father s face  o father  blessed words   thus  the rustling of an angel s wings got blended with the other echoes  and they were not wholly of earth  but had in them that breath of heaven  sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden tomb were mingled with them also  and both were audible to lucie  in a hushed murmur  like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore  as the little lucie  comically studious at the task of the morning  or dressing a doll at her mother s footstool  chattered in the tongues of the two cities that were blended in her life   the echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of sydney carton  some half dozen times a year  at most  he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited  and would sit among them through the evening  as he had once done often  he never came there heated with wine  and one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes  which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages   no man ever really loved a woman  lost her  and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind  when she was a wife and a mother  but her children had a strange sympathy with him  an instinctive delicacy of pity for him  what fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case  no echoes tell  but it is so  and it was so here  carton was the first stranger to whom little lucie held out her chubby arms  and he kept his place with her as she grew  the little boy had spoken of him  almost at the last   poor carton  kiss him for me    mr  stryver shouldered his way through the law  like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water  and dragged his useful friend in his wake  like a boat towed astern  as the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight  and mostly under water  so  sydney had a swamped life of it  but  easy and strong custom  unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace  made it the life he was to lead  and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lion s jackal  than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion  stryver was rich  had married a florid widow with property and three boys  who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads   these three young gentlemen  mr  stryver  exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore  had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in soho  and had offered as pupils to lucie s husband  delicately saying  halloa  here are three lumps of bread and cheese towards your matrimonial picnic  darnay   the polite rejection of the three lumps of bread and cheese had quite bloated mr  stryver with indignation  which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen  by directing them to beware of the pride of beggars  like that tutor fellow  he was also in the habit of declaiming to mrs  stryver  over his full bodied wine  on the arts mrs  darnay had once put in practice to  catch  him  and on the diamond cut diamond arts in himself  madam  which had rendered him  not to be caught   some of his king s bench familiars  who were occasionally parties to the full bodied wine and the lie  excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often  that he believed it himself  which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence  as to justify any such offender s being carried off to some suitably retired spot  and there hanged out of the way   these were among the echoes to which lucie  sometimes pensive  sometimes amused and laughing  listened in the echoing corner  until her little daughter was six years old  how near to her heart the echoes of her child s tread came  and those of her own dear father s  always active and self possessed  and those of her dear husband s  need not be told  nor  how the lightest echo of their united home  directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste  was music to her  nor  how there were echoes all about her  sweet in her ears  of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married  if that could be  than single  and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him  and asked her  what is the magic secret  my darling  of your being everything to all of us  as if there were only one of us  yet never seeming to be hurried  or to have too much to do    but  there were other echoes  from a distance  that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time  and it was now  about little lucie s sixth birthday  that they began to have an awful sound  as of a great storm in france with a dreadful sea rising   on a night in mid july  one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine  mr  lorry came in late  from tellson s  and sat himself down by lucie and her husband in the dark window  it was a hot  wild night  and they were all three reminded of the old sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place    i began to think   said mr  lorry  pushing his brown wig back   that i should have to pass the night at tellson s  we have been so full of business all day  that we have not known what to do first  or which way to turn  there is such an uneasiness in paris  that we have actually a run of confidence upon us  our customers over there  seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough  there is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to england     that has a bad look   said darnay     a bad look  you say  my dear darnay  yes  but we don t know what reason there is in it  people are so unreasonable  some of us at tellson s are getting old  and we really can t be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion     still   said darnay   you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is     i know that  to be sure   assented mr  lorry  trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured  and that he grumbled   but i am determined to be peevish after my long day s botheration  where is manette     here he is   said the doctor  entering the dark room at the moment    i am quite glad you are at home  for these hurries and forebodings by which i have been surrounded all day long  have made me nervous without reason  you are not going out  i hope     no  i am going to play backgammon with you  if you like   said the doctor    i don t think i do like  if i may speak my mind  i am not fit to be pitted against you to night  is the teaboard still there  lucie  i can t see     of course  it has been kept for you     thank ye  my dear  the precious child is safe in bed     and sleeping soundly     that s right  all safe and well  i don t know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here  thank god  but i have been so put out all day  and i am not as young as i was  my tea  my dear  thank ye  now  come and take your place in the circle  and let us sit quiet  and hear the echoes about which you have your theory     not a theory  it was a fancy     a fancy  then  my wise pet   said mr  lorry  patting her hand   they are very numerous and very loud  though  are they not  only hear them    headlong  mad  and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody s life  footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red  the footsteps raging in saint antoine afar off  as the little circle sat in the dark london window   saint antoine had been  that morning  a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro  with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads  where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun  a tremendous roar arose from the throat of saint antoine  and a forest of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind  all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below  no matter how far off   who gave them out  whence they last came  where they began  through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked  scores at a time  over the heads of the crowd  like a kind of lightning  no eye in the throng could have told  but  muskets were being distributed  so were cartridges  powder  and ball  bars of iron and wood  knives  axes  pikes  every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise  people who could lay hold of nothing else  set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls  every pulse and heart in saint antoine was on high fever strain and at high fever heat  every living creature there held life as of no account  and was demented with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it   as a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point  so  all this raging circled round defarge s wine shop  and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where defarge himself  already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat  issued orders  issued arms  thrust this man back  dragged this man forward  disarmed one to arm another  laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar    keep near to me  jacques three   cried defarge   and do you  jacques one and two  separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can  where is my wife     eh  well  here you see me   said madame  composed as ever  but not knitting to day  madame s resolute right hand was occupied with an axe  in place of the usual softer implements  and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife    where do you go  my wife     i go   said madame   with you at present  you shall see me at the head of women  by and bye     come  then   cried defarge  in a resounding voice   patriots and friends  we are ready  the bastille    with a roar that sounded as if all the breath in france had been shaped into the detested word  the living sea rose  wave on wave  depth on depth  and overflowed the city to that point  alarm bells ringing  drums beating  the sea raging and thundering on its new beach  the attack began   deep ditches  double drawbridge  massive stone walls  eight great towers  cannon  muskets  fire and smoke  through the fire and through the smoke  in the fire and in the smoke  for the sea cast him up against a cannon  and on the instant he became a cannonier  defarge of the wine shop worked like a manful soldier  two fierce hours   deep ditch  single drawbridge  massive stone walls  eight great towers  cannon  muskets  fire and smoke  one drawbridge down   work  comrades all  work  work  jacques one  jacques two  jacques one thousand  jacques two thousand  jacques five and twenty thousand  in the name of all the angels or the devils  which you prefer  work   thus defarge of the wine shop  still at his gun  which had long grown hot    to me  women   cried madame his wife   what  we can kill as well as the men when the place is taken   and to her  with a shrill thirsty cry  trooping women variously armed  but all armed alike in hunger and revenge   cannon  muskets  fire and smoke  but  still the deep ditch  the single drawbridge  the massive stone walls  and the eight great towers  slight displacements of the raging sea  made by the falling wounded  flashing weapons  blazing torches  smoking waggonloads of wet straw  hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions  shrieks  volleys  execrations  bravery without stint  boom smash and rattle  and the furious sounding of the living sea  but  still the deep ditch  and the single drawbridge  and the massive stone walls  and the eight great towers  and still defarge of the wine shop at his gun  grown doubly hot by the service of four fierce hours   a white flag from within the fortress  and a parley  this dimly perceptible through the raging storm  nothing audible in it  suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher  and swept defarge of the wine shop over the lowered drawbridge  past the massive stone outer walls  in among the eight great towers surrendered   so resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on  that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the south sea  until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the bastille  there  against an angle of a wall  he made a struggle to look about him  jacques three was nearly at his side  madame defarge  still heading some of her women  was visible in the inner distance  and her knife was in her hand  everywhere was tumult  exultation  deafening and maniacal bewilderment  astounding noise  yet furious dumb show    the prisoners     the records     the secret cells     the instruments of torture     the prisoners    of all these cries  and ten thousand incoherences   the prisoners   was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in  as if there were an eternity of people  as well as of time and space  when the foremost billows rolled past  bearing the prison officers with them  and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed  defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men  a man with a grey head  who had a lighted torch in his hand  separated him from the rest  and got him between himself and the wall    show me the north tower   said defarge   quick     i will faithfully   replied the man   if you will come with me  but there is no one there     what is the meaning of one hundred and five  north tower   asked defarge   quick     the meaning  monsieur     does it mean a captive  or a place of captivity  or do you mean that i shall strike you dead     kill him   croaked jacques three  who had come close up    monsieur  it is a cell     show it me     pass this way  then    jacques three  with his usual craving on him  and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed  held by defarge s arm as he held by the turnkey s  their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse  and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another  even then  so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean  in its irruption into the fortress  and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases  all around outside  too  it beat the walls with a deep  hoarse roar  from which  occasionally  some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray   through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone  past hideous doors of dark dens and cages  down cavernous flights of steps  and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick  more like dry waterfalls than staircases  defarge  the turnkey  and jacques three  linked hand and arm  went with all the speed they could make  here and there  especially at first  the inundation started on them and swept by  but when they had done descending  and were winding and climbing up a tower  they were alone  hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches  the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull  subdued way  as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing   the turnkey stopped at a low door  put a key in a clashing lock  swung the door slowly open  and said  as they all bent their heads and passed in    one hundred and five  north tower    there was a small  heavily grated  unglazed window high in the wall  with a stone screen before it  so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up  there was a small chimney  heavily barred across  a few feet within  there was a heap of old feathery wood ashes on the hearth  there was a stool  and table  and a straw bed  there were the four blackened walls  and a rusted iron ring in one of them    pass that torch slowly along these walls  that i may see them   said defarge to the turnkey   the man obeyed  and defarge followed the light closely with his eyes    stop   look here  jacques     a  m    croaked jacques three  as he read greedily    alexandre manette   said defarge in his ear  following the letters with his swart forefinger  deeply engrained with gunpowder   and here he wrote  a poor physician   and it was he  without doubt  who scratched a calendar on this stone  what is that in your hand  a crowbar  give it me    he had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand  he made a sudden exchange of the two instruments  and turning on the worm eaten stool and table  beat them to pieces in a few blows    hold the light higher   he said  wrathfully  to the turnkey   look among those fragments with care  jacques  and see  here is my knife    throwing it to him   rip open that bed  and search the straw  hold the light higher  you    with a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth  and  peering up the chimney  struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar  and worked at the iron grating across it  in a few minutes  some mortar and dust came dropping down  which he averted his face to avoid  and in it  and in the old wood ashes  and in a crevice in the chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself  he groped with a cautious touch    nothing in the wood  and nothing in the straw  jacques     nothing     let us collect them together  in the middle of the cell  so  light them  you    the turnkey fired the little pile  which blazed high and hot  stooping again to come out at the low arched door  they left it burning  and retraced their way to the courtyard  seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down  until they were in the raging flood once more   they found it surging and tossing  in quest of defarge himself  saint antoine was clamorous to have its wine shop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the bastille and shot the people  otherwise  the governor would not be marched to the hotel de ville for judgment  otherwise  the governor would escape  and the people s blood  suddenly of some value  after many years of worthlessness  be unavenged   in the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration  there was but one quite steady figure  and that was a woman s   see  there is my husband   she cried  pointing him out   see defarge   she stood immovable close to the grim old officer  and remained immovable close to him  remained immovable close to him through the streets  as defarge and the rest bore him along  remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination  and began to be struck at from behind  remained immovable close to him when the long gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy  was so close to him when he dropped dead under it  that  suddenly animated  she put her foot upon his neck  and with her cruel knife  long ready  hewed off his head   the hour was come  when saint antoine was to execute his horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do  saint antoine s blood was up  and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down  down on the steps of the hotel de ville where the governor s body lay  down on the sole of the shoe of madame defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation   lower the lamp yonder   cried saint antoine  after glaring round for a new means of death   here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard   the swinging sentinel was posted  and the sea rushed on   the sea of black and threatening waters  and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave  whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown  the remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes  voices of vengeance  and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them   but  in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life  there were two groups of faces  each seven in number  so fixedly contrasting with the rest  that never did sea roll which bore more memorable wrecks with it  seven faces of prisoners  suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb  were carried high overhead  all scared  all lost  all wondering and amazed  as if the last day were come  and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits  other seven faces there were  carried higher  seven dead faces  whose drooping eyelids and half seen eyes awaited the last day  impassive faces  yet with a suspended  not an abolished  expression on them  faces  rather  in a fearful pause  as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes  and bear witness with the bloodless lips   thou didst it    seven prisoners released  seven gory heads on pikes  the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers  some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time  long dead of broken hearts   such  and such  like  the loudly echoing footsteps of saint antoine escort through the paris streets in mid july  one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine  now  heaven defeat the fancy of lucie darnay  and keep these feet far out of her life  for  they are headlong  mad  and dangerous  and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at defarge s wine shop door  they are not easily purified when once stained red      xxii  the sea still rises   haggard saint antoine had had only one exultant week  in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could  with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations  when madame defarge sat at her counter  as usual  presiding over the customers  madame defarge wore no rose in her head  for the great brotherhood of spies had become  even in one short week  extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint s mercies  the lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them   madame defarge  with her arms folded  sat in the morning light and heat  contemplating the wine shop and the street  in both  there were several knots of loungers  squalid and miserable  but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress  the raggedest nightcap  awry on the wretchedest head  had this crooked significance in it   i know how hard it has grown for me  the wearer of this  to support life in myself  but do you know how easy it has grown for me  the wearer of this  to destroy life in you   every lean bare arm  that had been without work before  had this work always ready for it now  that it could strike  the fingers of the knitting women were vicious  with the experience that they could tear  there was a change in the appearance of saint antoine  the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years  and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression   madame defarge sat observing it  with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the saint antoine women  one of her sisterhood knitted beside her  the short  rather plump wife of a starved grocer  and the mother of two children withal  this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of the vengeance    hark   said the vengeance   listen  then  who comes    as if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of saint antoine quarter to the wine shop door  had been suddenly fired  a fast spreading murmur came rushing along    it is defarge   said madame   silence  patriots    defarge came in breathless  pulled off a red cap he wore  and looked around him   listen  everywhere   said madame again   listen to him    defarge stood  panting  against a background of eager eyes and open mouths  formed outside the door  all those within the wine shop had sprung to their feet    say then  my husband  what is it     news from the other world     how  then   cried madame  contemptuously   the other world     does everybody here recall old foulon  who told the famished people that they might eat grass  and who died  and went to hell     everybody   from all throats    the news is of him  he is among us     among us   from the universal throat again   and dead     not dead  he feared us so much  and with reason  that he caused himself to be represented as dead  and had a grand mock funeral  but they have found him alive  hiding in the country  and have brought him in  i have seen him but now  on his way to the hotel de ville  a prisoner  i have said that he had reason to fear us  say all  had he reason    wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten  if he had never known it yet  he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry   a moment of profound silence followed  defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another  the vengeance stooped  and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter    patriots   said defarge  in a determined voice   are we ready    instantly madame defarge s knife was in her girdle  the drum was beating in the streets  as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic  and the vengeance  uttering terrific shrieks  and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty furies at once  was tearing from house to house  rousing the women   the men were terrible  in the bloody minded anger with which they looked from windows  caught up what arms they had  and came pouring down into the streets  but  the women were a sight to chill the boldest  from such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded  from their children  from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked  they ran out with streaming hair  urging one another  and themselves  to madness with the wildest cries and actions  villain foulon taken  my sister  old foulon taken  my mother  miscreant foulon taken  my daughter  then  a score of others ran into the midst of these  beating their breasts  tearing their hair  and screaming  foulon alive  foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass  foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass  when i had no bread to give him  foulon who told my baby it might suck grass  when these breasts were dry with want  o mother of god  this foulon  o heaven our suffering  hear me  my dead baby and my withered father  i swear on my knees  on these stones  to avenge you on foulon  husbands  and brothers  and young men  give us the blood of foulon  give us the head of foulon  give us the heart of foulon  give us the body and soul of foulon  rend foulon to pieces  and dig him into the ground  that grass may grow from him  with these cries  numbers of the women  lashed into blind frenzy  whirled about  striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon  and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot   nevertheless  not a moment was lost  not a moment  this foulon was at the hotel de ville  and might be loosed  never  if saint antoine knew his own sufferings  insults  and wrongs  armed men and women flocked out of the quarter so fast  and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction  that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in saint antoine s bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children   no  they were all by that time choking the hall of examination where this old man  ugly and wicked  was  and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets  the defarges  husband and wife  the vengeance  and jacques three  were in the first press  and at no great distance from him in the hall    see   cried madame  pointing with her knife   see the old villain bound with ropes  that was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back  ha  ha  that was well done  let him eat it now   madame put her knife under her arm  and clapped her hands as at a play   the people immediately behind madame defarge  explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them  and those again explaining to others  and those to others  the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands  similarly  during two or three hours of drawl  and the winnowing of many bushels of words  madame defarge s frequent expressions of impatience were taken up  with marvellous quickness  at a distance  the more readily  because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows  knew madame defarge well  and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building   at length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or protection  directly down upon the old prisoner s head  the favour was too much to bear  in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long  went to the winds  and saint antoine had got him   it was known directly  to the furthest confines of the crowd  defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table  and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace  madame defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied  the vengeance and jacques three were not yet up with them  and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the hall  like birds of prey from their high perches  when the cry seemed to go up  all over the city   bring him out  bring him to the lamp    down  and up  and head foremost on the steps of the building  now  on his knees  now  on his feet  now  on his back  dragged  and struck at  and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands  torn  bruised  panting  bleeding  yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy  now full of vehement agony of action  with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see  now  a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs  he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung  and there madame defarge let him go  as a cat might have done to a mouse  and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready  and while he besought her  the women passionately screeching at him all the time  and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth  once  he went aloft  and the rope broke  and they caught him shrieking  twice  he went aloft  and the rope broke  and they caught him shrieking  then  the rope was merciful  and held him  and his head was soon upon a pike  with grass enough in the mouth for all saint antoine to dance at the sight of   nor was this the end of the day s bad work  for saint antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up  that it boiled again  on hearing when the day closed in that the son in law of the despatched  another of the people s enemies and insulters  was coming into paris under a guard five hundred strong  in cavalry alone  saint antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper  seized him  would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear foulon company  set his head and heart on pikes  and carried the three spoils of the day  in wolf procession through the streets   not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children  wailing and breadless  then  the miserable bakers  shops were beset by long files of them  patiently waiting to buy bad bread  and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty  they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day  and achieving them again in gossip  gradually  these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away  and then poor lights began to shine in high windows  and slender fires were made in the streets  at which neighbours cooked in common  afterwards supping at their doors   scanty and insufficient suppers those  and innocent of meat  as of most other sauce to wretched bread  yet  human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands  and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them  fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day  played gently with their meagre children  and lovers  with such a world around them and before them  loved and hoped   it was almost morning  when defarge s wine shop parted with its last knot of customers  and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife  in husky tones  while fastening the door    at last it is come  my dear     eh well   returned madame   almost    saint antoine slept  the defarges slept  even the vengeance slept with her starved grocer  and the drum was at rest  the drum s was the only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed  the vengeance  as custodian of the drum  could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the bastille fell  or old foulon was seized  not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in saint antoine s bosom      xxiii  fire rises   there was a change on the village where the fountain fell  and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together  the prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore  there were soldiers to guard it  but not many  there were officers to guard the soldiers  but not one of them knew what his men would do  beyond this  that it would probably not be what he was ordered   far and wide lay a ruined country  yielding nothing but desolation  every green leaf  every blade of grass and blade of grain  was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people  everything was bowed down  dejected  oppressed  and broken  habitations  fences  domesticated animals  men  women  children  and the soil that bore them  all worn out   monseigneur  often a most worthy individual gentleman  was a national blessing  gave a chivalrous tone to things  was a polite example of luxurious and shining life  and a great deal more to equal purpose  nevertheless  monseigneur as a class had  somehow or other  brought things to this  strange that creation  designed expressly for monseigneur  should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out  there must be something short sighted in the eternal arrangements  surely  thus it was  however  and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints  and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled  and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite  monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable   but  this was not the change on the village  and on many a village like it  for scores of years gone by  monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it  and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase  now  found in hunting the people  now  found in hunting the beasts  for whose preservation monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness  no  the change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste  rather than in the disappearance of the high caste  chiselled  and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of monseigneur   for  in these times  as the mender of roads worked  solitary  in the dust  not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return  being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it  in these times  as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour  and viewed the prospect  he would see some rough figure approaching on foot  the like of which was once a rarity in those parts  but was now a frequent presence  as it advanced  the mender of roads would discern without surprise  that it was a shaggy haired man  of almost barbarian aspect  tall  in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads  grim  rough  swart  steeped in the mud and dust of many highways  dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds  sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods   such a man came upon him  like a ghost  at noon in the july weather  as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank  taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail   the man looked at him  looked at the village in the hollow  at the mill  and at the prison on the crag  when he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had  he said  in a dialect that was just intelligible    how goes it  jacques     all well  jacques     touch then    they joined hands  and the man sat down on the heap of stones    no dinner     nothing but supper now   said the mender of roads  with a hungry face    it is the fashion   growled the man   i meet no dinner anywhere    he took out a blackened pipe  filled it  lighted it with flint and steel  pulled at it until it was in a bright glow  then  suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb  that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke    touch then   it was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time  after observing these operations  they again joined hands    to night   said the mender of roads    to night   said the man  putting the pipe in his mouth    where     here    he and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another  with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets  until the sky began to clear over the village    show me   said the traveller then  moving to the brow of the hill    see   returned the mender of roads  with extended finger   you go down here  and straight through the street  and past the fountain      to the devil with all that   interrupted the other  rolling his eye over the landscape   i go through no streets and past no fountains  well     well  about two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village     good  when do you cease to work     at sunset     will you wake me  before departing  i have walked two nights without resting  let me finish my pipe  and i shall sleep like a child  will you wake me     surely    the wayfarer smoked his pipe out  put it in his breast  slipped off his great wooden shoes  and lay down on his back on the heap of stones  he was fast asleep directly   as the road mender plied his dusty labour  and the hail clouds  rolling away  revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape  the little man  who wore a red cap now  in place of his blue one  seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones  his eyes were so often turned towards it  that he used his tools mechanically  and  one would have said  to very poor account  the bronze face  the shaggy black hair and beard  the coarse woollen red cap  the rough medley dress of home spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts  the powerful frame attenuated by spare living  and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep  inspired the mender of roads with awe  the traveller had travelled far  and his feet were footsore  and his ankles chafed and bleeding  his great shoes  stuffed with leaves and grass  had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues  and his clothes were chafed into holes  as he himself was into sores  stooping down beside him  the road mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not  but  in vain  for he slept with his arms crossed upon him  and set as resolutely as his lips  fortified towns with their stockades  guard houses  gates  trenches  and drawbridges  seemed to the mender of roads  to be so much air as against this figure  and when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around  he saw in his small fancy similar figures  stopped by no obstacle  tending to centres all over france   the man slept on  indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness  to sunshine on his face and shadow  to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them  until the sun was low in the west  and the sky was glowing  then  the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village  roused him    good   said the sleeper  rising on his elbow   two leagues beyond the summit of the hill     about     about  good    the mender of roads went home  with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind  and was soon at the fountain  squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink  and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village  when the village had taken its poor supper  it did not creep to bed  as it usually did  but came out of doors again  and remained there  a curious contagion of whispering was upon it  and also  when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark  another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only  monsieur gabelle  chief functionary of the place  became uneasy  went out on his house top alone  and looked in that direction too  glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below  and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church  that there might be need to ring the tocsin by and bye   the night deepened  the trees environing the old chateau  keeping its solitary state apart  moved in a rising wind  as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom  up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly  and beat at the great door  like a swift messenger rousing those within  uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall  among the old spears and knives  and passed lamenting up the stairs  and shook the curtains of the bed where the last marquis had slept  east  west  north  and south  through the woods  four heavy treading  unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches  striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard  four lights broke out there  and moved away in different directions  and all was black again   but  not for long  presently  the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own  as though it were growing luminous  then  a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front  picking out transparent places  and showing where balustrades  arches  and windows were  then it soared higher  and grew broader and brighter  soon  from a score of the great windows  flames burst forth  and the stone faces awakened  stared out of fire   a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there  and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away  there was spurring and splashing through the darkness  and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain  and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur gabelle s door   help  gabelle  help  every one   the tocsin rang impatiently  but other help  if that were any  there was none  the mender of roads  and two hundred and fifty particular friends  stood with folded arms at the fountain  looking at the pillar of fire in the sky   it must be forty feet high   said they  grimly  and never moved   the rider from the chateau  and the horse in a foam  clattered away through the village  and galloped up the stony steep  to the prison on the crag  at the gate  a group of officers were looking at the fire  removed from them  a group of soldiers   help  gentlemen  officers  the chateau is on fire  valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid  help  help   the officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire  gave no orders  and answered  with shrugs and biting of lips   it must burn    as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street  the village was illuminating  the mender of roads  and the two hundred and fifty particular friends  inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up  had darted into their houses  and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass  the general scarcity of everything  occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of monsieur gabelle  and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary s part  the mender of roads  once so submissive to authority  had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with  and that post horses would roast   the chateau was left to itself to flame and burn  in the roaring and raging of the conflagration  a red hot wind  driving straight from the infernal regions  seemed to be blowing the edifice away  with the rising and falling of the blaze  the stone faces showed as if they were in torment  when great masses of stone and timber fell  the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured  anon struggled out of the smoke again  as if it were the face of the cruel marquis  burning at the stake and contending with the fire   the chateau burned  the nearest trees  laid hold of by the fire  scorched and shrivelled  trees at a distance  fired by the four fierce figures  begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke  molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain  the water ran dry  the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat  and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame  great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls  like crystallisation  stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace  four fierce figures trudged away  east  west  north  and south  along the night enshrouded roads  guided by the beacon they had lighted  towards their next destination  the illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin  and  abolishing the lawful ringer  rang for joy   not only that  but the village  light headed with famine  fire  and bell ringing  and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes  though it was but a small instalment of taxes  and no rent at all  that gabelle had got in those latter days  became impatient for an interview with him  and  surrounding his house  summoned him to come forth for personal conference  whereupon  monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his door  and retire to hold counsel with himself  the result of that conference was  that gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys  this time resolved  if his door were broken in  he was a small southern man of retaliative temperament   to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet  and crush a man or two below   probably  monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there  with the distant chateau for fire and candle  and the beating at his door  combined with the joy ringing  for music  not to mention his having an ill omened lamp slung across the road before his posting house gate  which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour  a trying suspense  to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean  ready to take that plunge into it upon which monsieur gabelle had resolved  but  the friendly dawn appearing at last  and the rush candles of the village guttering out  the people happily dispersed  and monsieur gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while   within a hundred miles  and in the light of other fires  there were other functionaries less fortunate  that night and other nights  whom the rising sun found hanging across once peaceful streets  where they had been born and bred  also  there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows  upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success  and whom they strung up in their turn  but  the fierce figures were steadily wending east  west  north  and south  be that as it would  and whosoever hung  fire burned  the altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it  no functionary  by any stretch of mathematics  was able to calculate successfully      xxiv  drawn to the loadstone rock   in such risings of fire and risings of sea  the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb  but was always on the flow  higher and higher  to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore  three years of tempest were consumed  three more birthdays of little lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home   many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner  with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet  for  the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people  tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger  changed into wild beasts  by terrible enchantment long persisted in   monseigneur  as a class  had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated  of his being so little wanted in france  as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it  and this life together  like the fabled rustic who raised the devil with infinite pains  and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the enemy no question  but immediately fled  so  monseigneur  after boldly reading the lord s prayer backwards for a great number of years  and performing many other potent spells for compelling the evil one  no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels   the shining bull s eye of the court was gone  or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets  it had never been a good eye to see with  had long had the mote in it of lucifer s pride  sardanapalus s luxury  and a mole s blindness  but it had dropped out and was gone  the court  from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue  corruption  and dissimulation  was all gone together  royalty was gone  had been besieged in its palace and  suspended   when the last tidings came over   the august of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety two was come  and monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide   as was natural  the head quarters and great gathering place of monseigneur  in london  was tellson s bank  spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted  and monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be  moreover  it was the spot to which such french intelligence as was most to be relied upon  came quickest  again  tellson s was a munificent house  and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate  again  those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time  and anticipating plunder or confiscation  had made provident remittances to tellson s  were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren  to which it must be added that every new comer from france reported himself and his tidings at tellson s  almost as a matter of course  for such variety of reasons  tellson s was at that time  as to french intelligence  a kind of high exchange  and this was so well known to the public  and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous  that tellson s sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the bank windows  for all who ran through temple bar to read   on a steaming  misty afternoon  mr  lorry sat at his desk  and charles darnay stood leaning on it  talking with him in a low voice  the penitential den once set apart for interviews with the house  was now the news exchange  and was filled to overflowing  it was within half an hour or so of the time of closing    but  although you are the youngest man that ever lived   said charles darnay  rather hesitating   i must still suggest to you      i understand  that i am too old   said mr  lorry    unsettled weather  a long journey  uncertain means of travelling  a disorganised country  a city that may not be even safe for you     my dear charles   said mr  lorry  with cheerful confidence   you touch some of the reasons for my going  not for my staying away  it is safe enough for me  nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with  as to its being a disorganised city  if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our house here to our house there  who knows the city and the business  of old  and is in tellson s confidence  as to the uncertain travelling  the long journey  and the winter weather  if i were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of tellson s  after all these years  who ought to be     i wish i were going myself   said charles darnay  somewhat restlessly  and like one thinking aloud    indeed  you are a pretty fellow to object and advise   exclaimed mr  lorry   you wish you were going yourself  and you a frenchman born  you are a wise counsellor     my dear mr  lorry  it is because i am a frenchman born  that the thought  which i did not mean to utter here  however  has passed through my mind often  one cannot help thinking  having had some sympathy for the miserable people  and having abandoned something to them   he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner   that one might be listened to  and might have the power to persuade to some restraint  only last night  after you had left us  when i was talking to lucie      when you were talking to lucie   mr  lorry repeated   yes  i wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of lucie  wishing you were going to france at this time of day     however  i am not going   said charles darnay  with a smile   it is more to the purpose that you say you are     and i am  in plain reality  the truth is  my dear charles   mr  lorry glanced at the distant house  and lowered his voice   you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted  and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved  the lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people  if some of our documents were seized or destroyed  and they might be  at any time  you know  for who can say that paris is not set afire to day  or sacked to morrow  now  a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay  and the burying of them  or otherwise getting of them out of harm s way  is within the power  without loss of precious time  of scarcely any one but myself  if any one  and shall i hang back  when tellson s knows this and says this  tellson s  whose bread i have eaten these sixty years  because i am a little stiff about the joints  why  i am a boy  sir  to half a dozen old codgers here     how i admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit  mr  lorry     tut  nonsense  sir   and  my dear charles   said mr  lorry  glancing at the house again   you are to remember  that getting things out of paris at this present time  no matter what things  is next to an impossibility  papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here  i speak in strict confidence  it is not business like to whisper it  even to you   by the strangest bearers you can imagine  every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the barriers  at another time  our parcels would come and go  as easily as in business like old england  but now  everything is stopped     and do you really go to night     i really go to night  for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay     and do you take no one with you     all sorts of people have been proposed to me  but i will have nothing to say to any of them  i intend to take jerry  jerry has been my bodyguard on sunday nights for a long time past and i am used to him  nobody will suspect jerry of being anything but an english bull dog  or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master     i must say again that i heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness     i must say again  nonsense  nonsense  when i have executed this little commission  i shall  perhaps  accept tellson s proposal to retire and live at my ease  time enough  then  to think about growing old    this dialogue had taken place at mr  lorry s usual desk  with monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it  boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal people before long  it was too much the way of monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee  and it was much too much the way of native british orthodoxy  to talk of this terrible revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown  as if nothing had ever been done  or omitted to be done  that had led to it  as if observers of the wretched millions in france  and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous  had not seen it inevitably coming  years before  and had not in plain words recorded what they saw  such vapouring  combined with the extravagant plots of monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself  and worn out heaven and earth as well as itself  was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth  and it was such vapouring all about his ears  like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head  added to a latent uneasiness in his mind  which had already made charles darnay restless  and which still kept him so   among the talkers  was stryver  of the king s bench bar  far on his way to state promotion  and  therefore  loud on the theme  broaching to monseigneur  his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth  and doing without them  and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race  him  darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection  and darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more  and remaining to interpose his word  when the thing that was to be  went on to shape itself out   the house approached mr  lorry  and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him  asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed  the house laid the letter down so close to darnay that he saw the direction  the more quickly because it was his own right name  the address  turned into english  ran    very pressing  to monsieur heretofore the marquis st  evremonde  of france  confided to the cares of messrs  tellson and co   bankers  london  england    on the marriage morning  doctor manette had made it his one urgent and express request to charles darnay  that the secret of this name should be  unless he  the doctor  dissolved the obligation  kept inviolate between them  nobody else knew it to be his name  his own wife had no suspicion of the fact  mr  lorry could have none    no   said mr  lorry  in reply to the house   i have referred it  i think  to everybody now here  and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found    the hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the bank  there was a general set of the current of talkers past mr  lorry s desk  he held the letter out inquiringly  and monseigneur looked at it  in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee  and monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee  and this  that  and the other  all had something disparaging to say  in french or in english  concerning the marquis who was not to be found    nephew  i believe  but in any case degenerate successor  of the polished marquis who was murdered   said one   happy to say  i never knew him     a craven who abandoned his post   said another  this monseigneur had been got out of paris  legs uppermost and half suffocated  in a load of hay   some years ago     infected with the new doctrines   said a third  eyeing the direction through his glass in passing   set himself in opposition to the last marquis  abandoned the estates when he inherited them  and left them to the ruffian herd  they will recompense him now  i hope  as he deserves     hey   cried the blatant stryver   did he though  is that the sort of fellow  let us look at his infamous name  d  n the fellow    darnay  unable to restrain himself any longer  touched mr  stryver on the shoulder  and said    i know the fellow     do you  by jupiter   said stryver   i am sorry for it     why     why  mr  darnay  d ye hear what he did  don t ask  why  in these times     but i do ask why     then i tell you again  mr  darnay  i am sorry for it  i am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions  here is a fellow  who  infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known  abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale  and you ask me why i am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him  well  but i ll answer you  i am sorry because i believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel  that s why    mindful of the secret  darnay with great difficulty checked himself  and said   you may not understand the gentleman     i understand how to put you in a corner  mr  darnay   said bully stryver   and i ll do it  if this fellow is a gentleman  i don t understand him  you may tell him so  with my compliments  you may also tell him  from me  that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob  i wonder he is not at the head of them  but  no  gentlemen   said stryver  looking all round  and snapping his fingers   i know something of human nature  and i tell you that you ll never find a fellow like this fellow  trusting himself to the mercies of such precious protégés  no  gentlemen  he ll always show  em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle  and sneak away    with those words  and a final snap of his fingers  mr  stryver shouldered himself into fleet street  amidst the general approbation of his hearers  mr  lorry and charles darnay were left alone at the desk  in the general departure from the bank    will you take charge of the letter   said mr  lorry   you know where to deliver it     i do     will you undertake to explain  that we suppose it to have been addressed here  on the chance of our knowing where to forward it  and that it has been here some time     i will do so  do you start for paris from here     from here  at eight     i will come back  to see you off    very ill at ease with himself  and with stryver and most other men  darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the temple  opened the letter  and read it  these were its contents     prison of the abbaye  paris    june      monsieur heretofore the marquis    after having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village  i have been seized  with great violence and indignity  and brought a long journey on foot to paris  on the road i have suffered a great deal  nor is that all  my house has been destroyed  razed to the ground    the crime for which i am imprisoned  monsieur heretofore the marquis  and for which i shall be summoned before the tribunal  and shall lose my life  without your so generous help   is  they tell me  treason against the majesty of the people  in that i have acted against them for an emigrant  it is in vain i represent that i have acted for them  and not against  according to your commands  it is in vain i represent that  before the sequestration of emigrant property  i had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay  that i had collected no rent  that i had had recourse to no process  the only response is  that i have acted for an emigrant  and where is that emigrant    ah  most gracious monsieur heretofore the marquis  where is that emigrant  i cry in my sleep where is he  i demand of heaven  will he not come to deliver me  no answer  ah monsieur heretofore the marquis  i send my desolate cry across the sea  hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of tilson known at paris    for the love of heaven  of justice  of generosity  of the honour of your noble name  i supplicate you  monsieur heretofore the marquis  to succour and release me  my fault is  that i have been true to you  oh monsieur heretofore the marquis  i pray you be you true to me    from this prison here of horror  whence i every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction  i send you  monsieur heretofore the marquis  the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service    your afflicted    gabelle     the latent uneasiness in darnay s mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter  the peril of an old servant and a good one  whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family  stared him so reproachfully in the face  that  as he walked to and fro in the temple considering what to do  he almost hid his face from the passersby   he knew very well  that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house  in his resentful suspicions of his uncle  and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold  he had acted imperfectly  he knew very well  that in his love for lucie  his renunciation of his social place  though by no means new to his own mind  had been hurried and incomplete  he knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it  and that he had meant to do it  and that it had never been done   the happiness of his own chosen english home  the necessity of being always actively employed  the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast  that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week  and the events of the week following made all new again  he knew very well  that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded   not without disquiet  but still without continuous and accumulating resistance  that he had watched the times for a time of action  and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by  and the nobility were trooping from france by every highway and byway  and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction  and their very names were blotting out  was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in france that might impeach him for it   but  he had oppressed no man  he had imprisoned no man  he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues  that he had relinquished them of his own will  thrown himself on a world with no favour in it  won his own private place there  and earned his own bread  monsieur gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions  to spare the people  to give them what little there was to give  such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter  and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer  and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof  for his own safety  so that it could not but appear now   this favoured the desperate resolution charles darnay had begun to make  that he would go to paris   yes  like the mariner in the old story  the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the loadstone rock  and it was drawing him to itself  and he must go  everything that arose before his mind drifted him on  faster and faster  more and more steadily  to the terrible attraction  his latent uneasiness had been  that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments  and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they  was not there  trying to do something to stay bloodshed  and assert the claims of mercy and humanity  with this uneasiness half stifled  and half reproaching him  he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong  upon that comparison  injurious to himself  had instantly followed the sneers of monseigneur  which had stung him bitterly  and those of stryver  which above all were coarse and galling  for old reasons  upon those  had followed gabelle s letter  the appeal of an innocent prisoner  in danger of death  to his justice  honour  and good name   his resolution was made  he must go to paris   yes  the loadstone rock was drawing him  and he must sail on  until he struck  he knew of no rock  he saw hardly any danger  the intention with which he had done what he had done  even although he had left it incomplete  presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in france on his presenting himself to assert it  then  that glorious vision of doing good  which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds  arose before him  and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging revolution that was running so fearfully wild   as he walked to and fro with his resolution made  he considered that neither lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone  lucie should be spared the pain of separation  and her father  always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old  should come to the knowledge of the step  as a step taken  and not in the balance of suspense and doubt  how much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father  through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of france in his mind  he did not discuss with himself  but  that circumstance too  had had its influence in his course   he walked to and fro  with thoughts very busy  until it was time to return to tellson s and take leave of mr  lorry  as soon as he arrived in paris he would present himself to this old friend  but he must say nothing of his intention now   a carriage with post horses was ready at the bank door  and jerry was booted and equipped    i have delivered that letter   said charles darnay to mr  lorry   i would not consent to your being charged with any written answer  but perhaps you will take a verbal one     that i will  and readily   said mr  lorry   if it is not dangerous     not at all  though it is to a prisoner in the abbaye     what is his name   said mr  lorry  with his open pocket book in his hand    gabelle     gabelle  and what is the message to the unfortunate gabelle in prison     simply   that he has received the letter  and will come      any time mentioned     he will start upon his journey to morrow night     any person mentioned     no    he helped mr  lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks  and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old bank  into the misty air of fleet street   my love to lucie  and to little lucie   said mr  lorry at parting   and take precious care of them till i come back    charles darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled  as the carriage rolled away   that night  it was the fourteenth of august  he sat up late  and wrote two fervent letters  one was to lucie  explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to paris  and showing her  at length  the reasons that he had  for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there  the other was to the doctor  confiding lucie and their dear child to his care  and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances  to both  he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety  immediately after his arrival   it was a hard day  that day of being among them  with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind  it was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious  but  an affectionate glance at his wife  so happy and busy  made him resolute not to tell her what impended  he had been half moved to do it  so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid   and the day passed quickly  early in the evening he embraced her  and her scarcely less dear namesake  pretending that he would return by and bye  an imaginary engagement took him out  and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready   and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets  with a heavier heart   the unseen force was drawing him fast to itself  now  and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it  he left his two letters with a trusty porter  to be delivered half an hour before midnight  and no sooner  took horse for dover  and began his journey   for the love of heaven  of justice  of generosity  of the honour of your noble name   was the poor prisoner s cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart  as he left all that was dear on earth behind him  and floated away for the loadstone rock    the end of the second book       book the third  the track of a storm     i  in secret   the traveller fared slowly on his way  who fared towards paris from england in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety two  more than enough of bad roads  bad equipages  and bad horses  he would have encountered to delay him  though the fallen and unfortunate king of france had been upon his throne in all his glory  but  the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these  every town gate and village taxing house had its band of citizen patriots  with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness  who stopped all comers and goers  cross questioned them  inspected their papers  looked for their names in lists of their own  turned them back  or sent them on  or stopped them and laid them in hold  as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning republic one and indivisible  of liberty  equality  fraternity  or death   a very few french leagues of his journey were accomplished  when charles darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at paris  whatever might befall now  he must on to his journey s end  not a mean village closed upon him  not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him  but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and england  the universal watchfulness so encompassed him  that if he had been taken in a net  or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage  he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone   this universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage  but retarded his progress twenty times in a day  by riding after him and taking him back  riding before him and stopping him by anticipation  riding with him and keeping him in charge  he had been days upon his journey in france alone  when he went to bed tired out  in a little town on the high road  still a long way from paris   nothing but the production of the afflicted gabelle s letter from his prison of the abbaye would have got him on so far  his difficulty at the guard house in this small place had been such  that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis  and he was  therefore  as little surprised as a man could be  to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning  in the middle of the night   awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths  who sat down on the bed    emigrant   said the functionary   i am going to send you on to paris  under an escort     citizen  i desire nothing more than to get to paris  though i could dispense with the escort     silence   growled a red cap  striking at the coverlet with the butt end of his musket   peace  aristocrat     it is as the good patriot says   observed the timid functionary   you are an aristocrat  and must have an escort  and must pay for it     i have no choice   said charles darnay    choice  listen to him   cried the same scowling red cap   as if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp iron     it is always as the good patriot says   observed the functionary   rise and dress yourself  emigrant    darnay complied  and was taken back to the guard house  where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking  drinking  and sleeping  by a watch fire  here he paid a heavy price for his escort  and hence he started with it on the wet  wet roads at three o clock in the morning   the escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri coloured cockades  armed with national muskets and sabres  who rode one on either side of him   the escorted governed his own horse  but a loose line was attached to his bridle  the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist  in this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces  clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement  and out upon the mire deep roads  in this state they traversed without change  except of horses and pace  all the mire deep leagues that lay between them and the capital   they travelled in the night  halting an hour or two after daybreak  and lying by until the twilight fell  the escort were so wretchedly clothed  that they twisted straw round their bare legs  and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off  apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended  and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk  and carrying his musket very recklessly  charles darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast  for  he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated  and of representations  confirmable by the prisoner in the abbaye  that were not yet made   but when they came to the town of beauvais  which they did at eventide  when the streets were filled with people  he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming  an ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting yard  and many voices called out loudly   down with the emigrant    he stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle  and  resuming it as his safest place  said    emigrant  my friends  do you not see me here  in france  of my own will     you are a cursed emigrant   cried a farrier  making at him in a furious manner through the press  hammer in hand   and you are a cursed aristocrat    the postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider s bridle  at which he was evidently making   and soothingly said   let him be  let him be  he will be judged at paris     judged   repeated the farrier  swinging his hammer   ay  and condemned as a traitor   at this the crowd roared approval   checking the postmaster  who was for turning his horse s head to the yard  the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on  with the line round his wrist   darnay said  as soon as he could make his voice heard    friends  you deceive yourselves  or you are deceived  i am not a traitor     he lies   cried the smith   he is a traitor since the decree  his life is forfeit to the people  his cursed life is not his own    at the instant when darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd  which another instant would have brought upon him  the postmaster turned his horse into the yard  the escort rode in close upon his horse s flanks  and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates  the farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer  and the crowd groaned  but  no more was done    what is this decree that the smith spoke of   darnay asked the postmaster  when he had thanked him  and stood beside him in the yard    truly  a decree for selling the property of emigrants     when passed     on the fourteenth     the day i left england     everybody says it is but one of several  and that there will be others  if there are not already  banishing all emigrants  and condemning all to death who return  that is what he meant when he said your life was not your own     but there are no such decrees yet     what do i know   said the postmaster  shrugging his shoulders   there may be  or there will be  it is all the same  what would you have    they rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night  and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep  among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal  not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep  after long and lonely spurring over dreary roads  they would come to a cluster of poor cottages  not steeped in darkness  but all glittering with lights  and would find the people  in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night  circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of liberty  or all drawn up together singing a liberty song  happily  however  there was sleep in beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness  jingling through the untimely cold and wet  among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year  diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses  and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade  and sharp reining up across their way  of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads   daylight at last found them before the wall of paris  the barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it    where are the papers of this prisoner   demanded a resolute looking man in authority  who was summoned out by the guard   naturally struck by the disagreeable word  charles darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and french citizen  in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him  and which he had paid for    where   repeated the same personage  without taking any heed of him whatever   are the papers of this prisoner    the drunken patriot had them in his cap  and produced them  casting his eyes over gabelle s letter  the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise  and looked at darnay with a close attention   he left escort and escorted without saying a word  however  and went into the guard room  meanwhile  they sat upon their horses outside the gate  looking about him while in this state of suspense  charles darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots  the latter far outnumbering the former  and that while ingress into the city for peasants  carts bringing in supplies  and for similar traffic and traffickers  was easy enough  egress  even for the homeliest people  was very difficult  a numerous medley of men and women  not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts  was waiting to issue forth  but  the previous identification was so strict  that they filtered through the barrier very slowly  some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off  that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke  while others talked together  or loitered about  the red cap and tri colour cockade were universal  both among men and women   when he had sat in his saddle some half hour  taking note of these things  darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority  who directed the guard to open the barrier  then he delivered to the escort  drunk and sober  a receipt for the escorted  and requested him to dismount  he did so  and the two patriots  leading his tired horse  turned and rode away without entering the city   he accompanied his conductor into a guard room  smelling of common wine and tobacco  where certain soldiers and patriots  asleep and awake  drunk and sober  and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking  drunkenness and sobriety  were standing and lying about  the light in the guard house  half derived from the waning oil lamps of the night  and half from the overcast day  was in a correspondingly uncertain condition  some registers were lying open on a desk  and an officer of a coarse  dark aspect  presided over these    citizen defarge   said he to darnay s conductor  as he took a slip of paper to write on   is this the emigrant evremonde     this is the man     your age  evremonde     thirty seven     married  evremonde     yes     where married     in england     without doubt  where is your wife  evremonde     in england     without doubt  you are consigned  evremonde  to the prison of la force     just heaven   exclaimed darnay   under what law  and for what offence    the officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment    we have new laws  evremonde  and new offences  since you were here   he said it with a hard smile  and went on writing    i entreat you to observe that i have come here voluntarily  in response to that written appeal of a fellow countryman which lies before you  i demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay  is not that my right     emigrants have no rights  evremonde   was the stolid reply  the officer wrote until he had finished  read over to himself what he had written  sanded it  and handed it to defarge  with the words  in secret    defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him  the prisoner obeyed  and a guard of two armed patriots attended them    is it you   said defarge  in a low voice  as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into paris   who married the daughter of doctor manette  once a prisoner in the bastille that is no more     yes   replied darnay  looking at him with surprise    my name is defarge  and i keep a wine shop in the quarter saint antoine  possibly you have heard of me     my wife came to your house to reclaim her father  yes    the word  wife  seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to defarge  to say with sudden impatience   in the name of that sharp female newly born  and called la guillotine  why did you come to france     you heard me say why  a minute ago  do you not believe it is the truth     a bad truth for you   said defarge  speaking with knitted brows  and looking straight before him    indeed i am lost here  all here is so unprecedented  so changed  so sudden and unfair  that i am absolutely lost  will you render me a little help     none   defarge spoke  always looking straight before him    will you answer me a single question     perhaps  according to its nature  you can say what it is     in this prison that i am going to so unjustly  shall i have some free communication with the world outside     you will see     i am not to be buried there  prejudged  and without any means of presenting my case     you will see  but  what then  other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons  before now     but never by me  citizen defarge    defarge glanced darkly at him for answer  and walked on in a steady and set silence  the deeper he sank into this silence  the fainter hope there was  or so darnay thought  of his softening in any slight degree  he  therefore  made haste to say    it is of the utmost importance to me  you know  citizen  even better than i  of how much importance   that i should be able to communicate to mr  lorry of tellson s bank  an english gentleman who is now in paris  the simple fact  without comment  that i have been thrown into the prison of la force  will you cause that to be done for me     i will do   defarge doggedly rejoined   nothing for you  my duty is to my country and the people  i am the sworn servant of both  against you  i will do nothing for you    charles darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further  and his pride was touched besides  as they walked on in silence  he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets  the very children scarcely noticed him  a few passers turned their heads  and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat  otherwise  that a man in good clothes should be going to prison  was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work  in one narrow  dark  and dirty street through which they passed  an excited orator  mounted on a stool  was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people  of the king and the royal family  the few words that he caught from this man s lips  first made it known to charles darnay that the king was in prison  and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left paris  on the road  except at beauvais  he had heard absolutely nothing  the escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him   that he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left england  he of course knew now  that perils had thickened about him fast  and might thicken faster and faster yet  he of course knew now  he could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey  if he could have foreseen the events of a few days  and yet his misgivings were not so dark as  imagined by the light of this later time  they would appear  troubled as the future was  it was the unknown future  and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope  the horrible massacre  days and nights long  which  within a few rounds of the clock  was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest  was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away  the  sharp female newly born  and called la guillotine   was hardly known to him  or to the generality of people  by name  the frightful deeds that were to be soon done  were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers  how could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind   of unjust treatment in detention and hardship  and in cruel separation from his wife and child  he foreshadowed the likelihood  or the certainty  but  beyond this  he dreaded nothing distinctly  with this on his mind  which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard  he arrived at the prison of la force   a man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket  to whom defarge presented  the emigrant evremonde     what the devil  how many more of them   exclaimed the man with the bloated face   defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation  and withdrew  with his two fellow patriots    what the devil  i say again   exclaimed the gaoler  left with his wife   how many more    the gaoler s wife  being provided with no answer to the question  merely replied   one must have patience  my dear   three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang  echoed the sentiment  and one added   for the love of liberty   which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion   the prison of la force was a gloomy prison  dark and filthy  and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it  extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep  becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for    in secret  too   grumbled the gaoler  looking at the written paper   as if i was not already full to bursting    he stuck the paper on a file  in an ill humour  and charles darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour  sometimes  pacing to and fro in the strong arched room  sometimes  resting on a stone seat  in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates    come   said the chief  at length taking up his keys   come with me  emigrant    through the dismal prison twilight  his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase  many doors clanging and locking behind them  until they came into a large  low  vaulted chamber  crowded with prisoners of both sexes  the women were seated at a long table  reading and writing  knitting  sewing  and embroidering  the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs  or lingering up and down the room   in the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace  the new comer recoiled from this company  but the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride  was  their all at once rising to receive him  with every refinement of manner known to the time  and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life   so strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom  so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen  that charles darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead  ghosts all  the ghost of beauty  the ghost of stateliness  the ghost of elegance  the ghost of pride  the ghost of frivolity  the ghost of wit  the ghost of youth  the ghost of age  all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore  all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there   it struck him motionless  the gaoler standing at his side  and the other gaolers moving about  who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions  looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there  with the apparitions of the coquette  the young beauty  and the mature woman delicately bred  that the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented  was heightened to its utmost  surely  ghosts all  surely  the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades    in the name of the assembled companions in misfortune   said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address  coming forward   i have the honour of giving you welcome to la force  and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us  may it soon terminate happily  it would be an impertinence elsewhere  but it is not so here  to ask your name and condition    charles darnay roused himself  and gave the required information  in words as suitable as he could find    but i hope   said the gentleman  following the chief gaoler with his eyes  who moved across the room   that you are not in secret     i do not understand the meaning of the term  but i have heard them say so     ah  what a pity  we so much regret it  but take courage  several members of our society have been in secret  at first  and it has lasted but a short time   then he added  raising his voice   i grieve to inform the society  in secret    there was a murmur of commiseration as charles darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him  and many voices  among which  the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous  gave him good wishes and encouragement  he turned at the grated door  to render the thanks of his heart  it closed under the gaoler s hand  and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever   the wicket opened on a stone staircase  leading upward  when they had ascended forty steps  the prisoner of half an hour already counted them   the gaoler opened a low black door  and they passed into a solitary cell  it struck cold and damp  but was not dark    yours   said the gaoler    why am i confined alone     how do i know     i can buy pen  ink  and paper     such are not my orders  you will be visited  and can ask then  at present  you may buy your food  and nothing more    there were in the cell  a chair  a table  and a straw mattress  as the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects  and of the four walls  before going out  a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him  that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated  both in face and person  as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water  when the gaoler was gone  he thought in the same wandering way   now am i left  as if i were dead   stopping then  to look down at the mattress  he turned from it with a sick feeling  and thought   and here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death     five paces by four and a half  five paces by four and a half  five paces by four and a half   the prisoner walked to and fro in his cell  counting its measurement  and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them   he made shoes  he made shoes  he made shoes   the prisoner counted the measurement again  and paced faster  to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition   the ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed  there was one among them  the appearance of a lady dressed in black  who was leaning in the embrasure of a window  and she had a light shining upon her golden hair  and she looked like         let us ride on again  for god s sake  through the illuminated villages with the people all awake          he made shoes  he made shoes  he made shoes          five paces by four and a half   with such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind  the prisoner walked faster and faster  obstinately counting and counting  and the roar of the city changed to this extent  that it still rolled in like muffled drums  but with the wail of voices that he knew  in the swell that rose above them      ii  the grindstone   tellson s bank  established in the saint germain quarter of paris  was in a wing of a large house  approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate  the house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles  in his own cook s dress  and got across the borders  a mere beast of the chase flying from hunters  he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same monseigneur  the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question   monseigneur gone  and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages  by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning republic one and indivisible of liberty  equality  fraternity  or death  monseigneur s house had been first sequestrated  and then confiscated  for  all things moved so fast  and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation  that now upon the third night of the autumn month of september  patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of monseigneur s house  and had marked it with the tri colour  and were drinking brandy in its state apartments   a place of business in london like tellson s place of business in paris  would soon have driven the house out of its mind and into the gazette  for  what would staid british responsibility and respectability have said to orange trees in boxes in a bank courtyard  and even to a cupid over the counter  yet such things were  tellson s had whitewashed the cupid  but he was still to be seen on the ceiling  in the coolest linen  aiming  as he very often does  at money from morning to night  bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young pagan  in lombard street  london  and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy  and also of a looking glass let into the wall  and also of clerks not at all old  who danced in public on the slightest provocation  yet  a french tellson s could get on with these things exceedingly well  and  as long as the times held together  no man had taken fright at them  and drawn out his money   what money would be drawn out of tellson s henceforth  and what would lie there  lost and forgotten  what plate and jewels would tarnish in tellson s hiding places  while the depositors rusted in prisons  and when they should have violently perished  how many accounts with tellson s never to be balanced in this world  must be carried over into the next  no man could have said  that night  any more than mr  jarvis lorry could  though he thought heavily of these questions  he sat by a newly lighted wood fire  the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold   and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw  or any object in the room distortedly reflect  a shade of horror   he occupied rooms in the bank  in his fidelity to the house of which he had grown to be a part  like strong root ivy  it chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building  but the true hearted old gentleman never calculated about that  all such circumstances were indifferent to him  so that he did his duty  on the opposite side of the courtyard  under a colonnade  was extensive standing  for carriages  where  indeed  some carriages of monseigneur yet stood  against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux  and in the light of these  standing out in the open air  was a large grindstone  a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy  or other workshop  rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects  mr  lorry shivered  and retired to his seat by the fire  he had opened  not only the glass window  but the lattice blind outside it  and he had closed both again  and he shivered through his frame   from the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate  there came the usual night hum of the city  with now and then an indescribable ring in it  weird and unearthly  as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to heaven    thank god   said mr  lorry  clasping his hands   that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to night  may he have mercy on all who are in danger    soon afterwards  the bell at the great gate sounded  and he thought   they have come back   and sat listening  but  there was no loud irruption into the courtyard  as he had expected  and he heard the gate clash again  and all was quiet   the nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the bank  which a great change would naturally awaken  with such feelings roused  it was well guarded  and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it  when his door suddenly opened  and two figures rushed in  at sight of which he fell back in amazement   lucie and her father  lucie with her arms stretched out to him  and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified  that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life    what is this   cried mr  lorry  breathless and confused   what is the matter  lucie  manette  what has happened  what has brought you here  what is it    with the look fixed upon him  in her paleness and wildness  she panted out in his arms  imploringly   o my dear friend  my husband     your husband  lucie     charles     what of charles     here    here  in paris     has been here some days  three or four  i don t know how many  i can t collect my thoughts  an errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us  he was stopped at the barrier  and sent to prison    the old man uttered an irrepressible cry  almost at the same moment  the bell of the great gate rang again  and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard    what is that noise   said the doctor  turning towards the window    don t look   cried mr  lorry   don t look out  manette  for your life  don t touch the blind    the doctor turned  with his hand upon the fastening of the window  and said  with a cool  bold smile    my dear friend  i have a charmed life in this city  i have been a bastille prisoner  there is no patriot in paris  in paris  in france  who  knowing me to have been a prisoner in the bastille  would touch me  except to overwhelm me with embraces  or carry me in triumph  my old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier  and gained us news of charles there  and brought us here  i knew it would be so  i knew i could help charles out of all danger  i told lucie so   what is that noise   his hand was again upon the window    don t look   cried mr  lorry  absolutely desperate   no  lucie  my dear  nor you   he got his arm round her  and held her   don t be so terrified  my love  i solemnly swear to you that i know of no harm having happened to charles  that i had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place  what prison is he in     la force     la force  lucie  my child  if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life  and you were always both  you will compose yourself now  to do exactly as i bid you  for more depends upon it than you can think  or i can say  there is no help for you in any action on your part to night  you cannot possibly stir out  i say this  because what i must bid you to do for charles s sake  is the hardest thing to do of all  you must instantly be obedient  still  and quiet  you must let me put you in a room at the back here  you must leave your father and me alone for two minutes  and as there are life and death in the world you must not delay     i will be submissive to you  i see in your face that you know i can do nothing else than this  i know you are true    the old man kissed her  and hurried her into his room  and turned the key  then  came hurrying back to the doctor  and opened the window and partly opened the blind  and put his hand upon the doctor s arm  and looked out with him into the courtyard   looked out upon a throng of men and women  not enough in number  or near enough  to fill the courtyard  not more than forty or fifty in all  the people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate  and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone  it had evidently been set up there for their purpose  as in a convenient and retired spot   but  such awful workers  and such awful work   the grindstone had a double handle  and  turning at it madly were two men  whose faces  as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up  were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise  false eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them  and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty  and all awry with howling  and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep  as these ruffians turned and turned  their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes  now flung backward over their necks  some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink  and what with dropping blood  and what with dropping wine  and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone  all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire  the eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood  shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening stone  were men stripped to the waist  with the stain all over their limbs and bodies  men in all sorts of rags  with the stain upon those rags  men devilishly set off with spoils of women s lace and silk and ribbon  with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through  hatchets  knives  bayonets  swords  all brought to be sharpened  were all red with it  some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them  with strips of linen and fragments of dress  ligatures various in kind  but all deep of the one colour  and as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets  the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes   eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life  to petrify with a well directed gun   all this was seen in a moment  as the vision of a drowning man  or of any human creature at any very great pass  could see a world if it were there  they drew back from the window  and the doctor looked for explanation in his friend s ashy face    they are   mr  lorry whispered the words  glancing fearfully round at the locked room   murdering the prisoners  if you are sure of what you say  if you really have the power you think you have  as i believe you have  make yourself known to these devils  and get taken to la force  it may be too late  i don t know  but let it not be a minute later    doctor manette pressed his hand  hastened bareheaded out of the room  and was in the courtyard when mr  lorry regained the blind   his streaming white hair  his remarkable face  and the impetuous confidence of his manner  as he put the weapons aside like water  carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone  for a few moments there was a pause  and a hurry  and a murmur  and the unintelligible sound of his voice  and then mr  lorry saw him  surrounded by all  and in the midst of a line of twenty men long  all linked shoulder to shoulder  and hand to shoulder  hurried out with cries of   live the bastille prisoner  help for the bastille prisoner s kindred in la force  room for the bastille prisoner in front there  save the prisoner evremonde at la force   and a thousand answering shouts   he closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart  closed the window and the curtain  hastened to lucie  and told her that her father was assisted by the people  and gone in search of her husband  he found her child and miss pross with her  but  it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards  when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew   lucie had  by that time  fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet  clinging to his hand  miss pross had laid the child down on his own bed  and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge  o the long  long night  with the moans of the poor wife  and o the long  long night  with no return of her father and no tidings   twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded  and the irruption was repeated  and the grindstone whirled and spluttered   what is it   cried lucie  affrighted   hush  the soldiers  swords are sharpened there   said mr  lorry   the place is national property now  and used as a kind of armoury  my love    twice more in all  but  the last spell of work was feeble and fitful  soon afterwards the day began to dawn  and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand  and cautiously looked out again  a man  so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain  was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone  and looking about him with a vacant air  shortly  this worn out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of monseigneur  and  staggering to that gorgeous vehicle  climbed in at the door  and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions   the great grindstone  earth  had turned when mr  lorry looked out again  and the sun was red on the courtyard  but  the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air  with a red upon it that the sun had never given  and would never take away      iii  the shadow   one of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of mr  lorry when business hours came round  was this   that he had no right to imperil tellson s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the bank roof  his own possessions  safety  life  he would have hazarded for lucie and her child  without a moment s demur  but the great trust he held was not his own  and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business   at first  his mind reverted to defarge  and he thought of finding out the wine shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling place in the distracted state of the city  but  the same consideration that suggested him  repudiated him  he lived in the most violent quarter  and doubtless was influential there  and deep in its dangerous workings   noon coming  and the doctor not returning  and every minute s delay tending to compromise tellson s  mr  lorry advised with lucie  she said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term  in that quarter  near the banking house  as there was no business objection to this  and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with charles  and he were to be released  he could not hope to leave the city  mr  lorry went out in quest of such a lodging  and found a suitable one  high up in a removed by street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes   to this lodging he at once removed lucie and her child  and miss pross  giving them what comfort he could  and much more than he had himself  he left jerry with them  as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head  and returned to his own occupations  a disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them  and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him   it wore itself out  and wore him out with it  until the bank closed  he was again alone in his room of the previous night  considering what to do next  when he heard a foot upon the stair  in a few moments  a man stood in his presence  who  with a keenly observant look at him  addressed him by his name    your servant   said mr  lorry   do you know me    he was a strongly made man with dark curling hair  from forty five to fifty years of age  for answer he repeated  without any change of emphasis  the words    do you know me     i have seen you somewhere     perhaps at my wine shop    much interested and agitated  mr  lorry said   you come from doctor manette     yes  i come from doctor manette     and what says he  what does he send me    defarge gave into his anxious hand  an open scrap of paper  it bore the words in the doctor s writing        charles is safe  but i cannot safely leave this place yet       i have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note      from charles to his wife   let the bearer see his wife    it was dated from la force  within an hour    will you accompany me   said mr  lorry  joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud   to where his wife resides     yes   returned defarge   scarcely noticing as yet  in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way defarge spoke  mr  lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard  there  they found two women  one  knitting    madame defarge  surely   said mr  lorry  who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago    it is she   observed her husband    does madame go with us   inquired mr  lorry  seeing that she moved as they moved    yes  that she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons  it is for their safety    beginning to be struck by defarge s manner  mr  lorry looked dubiously at him  and led the way  both the women followed  the second woman being the vengeance   they passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might  ascended the staircase of the new domicile  were admitted by jerry  and found lucie weeping  alone  she was thrown into a transport by the tidings mr  lorry gave her of her husband  and clasped the hand that delivered his note  little thinking what it had been doing near him in the night  and might  but for a chance  have done to him         dearest   take courage   i am well  and your father has       influence around me   you cannot answer this        kiss our child for me    that was all the writing  it was so much  however  to her who received it  that she turned from defarge to his wife  and kissed one of the hands that knitted  it was a passionate  loving  thankful  womanly action  but the hand made no response  dropped cold and heavy  and took to its knitting again   there was something in its touch that gave lucie a check  she stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom  and  with her hands yet at her neck  looked terrified at madame defarge  madame defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold  impassive stare    my dear   said mr  lorry  striking in to explain   there are frequent risings in the streets  and  although it is not likely they will ever trouble you  madame defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times  to the end that she may know them  that she may identify them  i believe   said mr  lorry  rather halting in his reassuring words  as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more   i state the case  citizen defarge    defarge looked gloomily at his wife  and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence    you had better  lucie   said mr  lorry  doing all he could to propitiate  by tone and manner   have the dear child here  and our good pross  our good pross  defarge  is an english lady  and knows no french    the lady in question  whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner  was not to be shaken by distress and  danger  appeared with folded arms  and observed in english to the vengeance  whom her eyes first encountered   well  i am sure  boldface  i hope you are pretty well   she also bestowed a british cough on madame defarge  but  neither of the two took much heed of her    is that his child   said madame defarge  stopping in her work for the first time  and pointing her knitting needle at little lucie as if it were the finger of fate    yes  madame   answered mr  lorry   this is our poor prisoner s darling daughter  and only child    the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child  that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her  and held her to her breast  the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed then to fall  threatening and dark  on both the mother and the child    it is enough  my husband   said madame defarge   i have seen them  we may go    but  the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it  not visible and presented  but indistinct and withheld  to alarm lucie into saying  as she laid her appealing hand on madame defarge s dress    you will be good to my poor husband  you will do him no harm  you will help me to see him if you can     your husband is not my business here   returned madame defarge  looking down at her with perfect composure   it is the daughter of your father who is my business here     for my sake  then  be merciful to my husband  for my child s sake  she will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful  we are more afraid of you than of these others    madame defarge received it as a compliment  and looked at her husband  defarge  who had been uneasily biting his thumb nail and looking at her  collected his face into a sterner expression    what is it that your husband says in that little letter   asked madame defarge  with a lowering smile   influence  he says something touching influence     that my father   said lucie  hurriedly taking the paper from her breast  but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it   has much influence around him     surely it will release him   said madame defarge   let it do so     as a wife and mother   cried lucie  most earnestly   i implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess  against my innocent husband  but to use it in his behalf  o sister woman  think of me  as a wife and mother    madame defarge looked  coldly as ever  at the suppliant  and said  turning to her friend the vengeance    the wives and mothers we have been used to see  since we were as little as this child  and much less  have not been greatly considered  we have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them  often enough  all our lives  we have seen our sister women suffer  in themselves and in their children  poverty  nakedness  hunger  thirst  sickness  misery  oppression and neglect of all kinds     we have seen nothing else   returned the vengeance    we have borne this a long time   said madame defarge  turning her eyes again upon lucie   judge you  is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now    she resumed her knitting and went out  the vengeance followed  defarge went last  and closed the door    courage  my dear lucie   said mr  lorry  as he raised her   courage  courage  so far all goes well with us  much  much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls  cheer up  and have a thankful heart     i am not thankless  i hope  but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes     tut  tut   said mr  lorry   what is this despondency in the brave little breast  a shadow indeed  no substance in it  lucie    but the shadow of the manner of these defarges was dark upon himself  for all that  and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly      iv  calm in storm   doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence  so much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of lucie was so well concealed from her  that not until long afterwards  when france and she were far apart  did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace  that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror  and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain  she only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons  that all political prisoners had been in danger  and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered   to mr  lorry  the doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell  that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of la force  that  in the prison he had found a self appointed tribunal sitting  before which the prisoners were brought singly  and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred  or to be released  or  in a few cases  to be sent back to their cells  that  presented by his conductors to this tribunal  he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the bastille  that  one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him  and that this man was defarge   that  hereupon he had ascertained  through the registers on the table  that his son in law was among the living prisoners  and had pleaded hard to the tribunal  of whom some members were asleep and some awake  some dirty with murder and some clean  some sober and some not  for his life and liberty  that  in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system  it had been accorded to him to have charles darnay brought before the lawless court  and examined  that  he seemed on the point of being at once released  when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check  not intelligible to the doctor   which led to a few words of secret conference  that  the man sitting as president had then informed doctor manette that the prisoner must remain in custody  but should  for his sake  be held inviolate in safe custody  that  immediately  on a signal  the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again  but  that he  the doctor  had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son in law was  through no malice or mischance  delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings  that he had obtained the permission  and had remained in that hall of blood until the danger was over   the sights he had seen there  with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals  shall remain untold  the mad joy over the prisoners who were saved  had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces  one prisoner there was  he said  who had been discharged into the street free  but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out  being besought to go to him and dress the wound  the doctor had passed out at the same gate  and had found him in the arms of a company of samaritans  who were seated on the bodies of their victims  with an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare  they had helped the healer  and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude  had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spot  had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful  that the doctor had covered his eyes with his hands  and swooned away in the midst of it   as mr  lorry received these confidences  and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty two years of age  a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger   but  he had never seen his friend in his present aspect  he had never at all known him in his present character  for the first time the doctor felt  now  that his suffering was strength and power  for the first time he felt that in that sharp fire  he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter s husband  and deliver him   it all tended to a good end  my friend  it was not mere waste and ruin  as my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself  i will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her  by the aid of heaven i will do it   thus  doctor manette  and when jarvis lorry saw the kindled eyes  the resolute face  the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped  like a clock  for so many years  and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness  he believed   greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend with  would have yielded before his persevering purpose  while he kept himself in his place  as a physician  whose business was with all degrees of mankind  bond and free  rich and poor  bad and good  he used his personal influence so wisely  that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons  and among them of la force  he could now assure lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone  but was mixed with the general body of prisoners  he saw her husband weekly  and brought sweet messages to her  straight from his lips  sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her  though never by the doctor s hand   but she was not permitted to write to him  for  among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons  the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad   this new life of the doctor s was an anxious life  no doubt  still  the sagacious mr  lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it  nothing unbecoming tinged the pride  it was a natural and worthy one  but he observed it as a curiosity  the doctor knew  that up to that time  his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend  with his personal affliction  deprivation  and weakness  now that this was changed  and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for charles s ultimate safety and deliverance  he became so far exalted by the change  that he took the lead and direction  and required them as the weak  to trust to him as the strong  the preceding relative positions of himself and lucie were reversed  yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them  for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him   all curious to see   thought mr  lorry  in his amiably shrewd way   but all natural and right  so  take the lead  my dear friend  and keep it  it couldn t be in better hands    but  though the doctor tried hard  and never ceased trying  to get charles darnay set at liberty  or at least to get him brought to trial  the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him  the new era began  the king was tried  doomed  and beheaded  the republic of liberty  equality  fraternity  or death  declared for victory or death against the world in arms  the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of notre dame  three hundred thousand men  summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth  rose from all the varying soils of france  as if the dragon s teeth had been sown broadcast  and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain  on rock  in gravel  and alluvial mud  under the bright sky of the south and under the clouds of the north  in fell and forest  in the vineyards and the olive grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn  along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers  and in the sand of the sea shore  what private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the year one of liberty  the deluge rising from below  not falling from above  and with the windows of heaven shut  not opened   there was no pause  no pity  no peace  no interval of relenting rest  no measurement of time  though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young  and the evening and morning were the first day  other count of time there was none  hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation  as it is in the fever of one patient  now  breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city  the executioner showed the people the head of the king  and now  it seemed almost in the same breath  the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery  to turn it grey   and yet  observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases  the time was long  while it flamed by so fast  a revolutionary tribunal in the capital  and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land  a law of the suspected  which struck away all security for liberty or life  and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one  prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence  and could obtain no hearing  these things became the established order and nature of appointed things  and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old  above all  one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the world  the figure of the sharp female called la guillotine   it was the popular theme for jests  it was the best cure for headache  it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey  it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion  it was the national razor which shaved close  who kissed la guillotine  looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack  it was the sign of the regeneration of the human race  it superseded the cross  models of it were worn on breasts from which the cross was discarded  and it was bowed down to and believed in where the cross was denied   it sheared off heads so many  that it  and the ground it most polluted  were a rotten red  it was taken to pieces  like a toy puzzle for a young devil  and was put together again when the occasion wanted it  it hushed the eloquent  struck down the powerful  abolished the beautiful and good  twenty two friends of high public mark  twenty one living and one dead  it had lopped the heads off  in one morning  in as many minutes  the name of the strong man of old scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it  but  so armed  he was stronger than his namesake  and blinder  and tore away the gates of god s own temple every day   among these terrors  and the brood belonging to them  the doctor walked with a steady head  confident in his power  cautiously persistent in his end  never doubting that he would save lucie s husband at last  yet the current of the time swept by  so strong and deep  and carried the time away so fiercely  that charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the doctor was thus steady and confident  so much more wicked and distracted had the revolution grown in that december month  that the rivers of the south were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night  and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun  still  the doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head  no man better known than he  in paris at that day  no man in a stranger situation  silent  humane  indispensable in hospital and prison  using his art equally among assassins and victims  he was a man apart  in the exercise of his skill  the appearance and the story of the bastille captive removed him from all other men  he was not suspected or brought in question  any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before  or were a spirit moving among mortals      v  the wood sawyer   one year and three months  during all that time lucie was never sure  from hour to hour  but that the guillotine would strike off her husband s head next day  every day  through the stony streets  the tumbrils now jolted heavily  filled with condemned  lovely girls  bright women  brown haired  black haired  and grey  youths  stalwart men and old  gentle born and peasant born  all red wine for la guillotine  all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons  and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst  liberty  equality  fraternity  or death   the last  much the easiest to bestow  o guillotine   if the suddenness of her calamity  and the whirling wheels of the time  had stunned the doctor s daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair  it would but have been with her as it was with many  but  from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of saint antoine  she had been true to her duties  she was truest to them in the season of trial  as all the quietly loyal and good will always be   as soon as they were established in their new residence  and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations  she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there  everything had its appointed place and its appointed time  little lucie she taught  as regularly  as if they had all been united in their english home  the slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunited  the little preparations for his speedy return  the setting aside of his chair and his books  these  and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially  among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death  were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind   she did not greatly alter in appearance  the plain dark dresses  akin to mourning dresses  which she and her child wore  were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days  she lost her colour  and the old and intent expression was a constant  not an occasional  thing  otherwise  she remained very pretty and comely  sometimes  at night on kissing her father  she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day  and would say that her sole reliance  under heaven  was on him  he always resolutely answered   nothing can happen to him without my knowledge  and i know that i can save him  lucie    they had not made the round of their changed life many weeks  when her father said to her  on coming home one evening    my dear  there is an upper window in the prison  to which charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon  when he can get to it  which depends on many uncertainties and incidents  he might see you in the street  he thinks  if you stood in a certain place that i can show you  but you will not be able to see him  my poor child  and even if you could  it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition     o show me the place  my father  and i will go there every day    from that time  in all weathers  she waited there two hours  as the clock struck two  she was there  and at four she turned resignedly away  when it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her  they went together  at other times she was alone  but  she never missed a single day   it was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street  the hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning  was the only house at that end  all else was wall  on the third day of her being there  he noticed her    good day  citizeness     good day  citizen    this mode of address was now prescribed by decree  it had been established voluntarily some time ago  among the more thorough patriots  but  was now law for everybody    walking here again  citizeness     you see me  citizen    the wood sawyer  who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture  he had once been a mender of roads   cast a glance at the prison  pointed at the prison  and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars  peeped through them jocosely    but it s not my business   said he  and went on sawing his wood   next day he was looking out for her  and accosted her the moment she appeared    what  walking here again  citizeness     yes  citizen     ah  a child too  your mother  is it not  my little citizeness     do i say yes  mamma   whispered little lucie  drawing close to her    yes  dearest     yes  citizen     ah  but it s not my business  my work is my business  see my saw  i call it my little guillotine  la  la  la  la  la  la  and off his head comes    the billet fell as he spoke  and he threw it into a basket    i call myself the samson of the firewood guillotine  see here again  loo  loo  loo  loo  loo  loo  and off her head comes  now  a child  tickle  tickle  pickle  pickle  and off its head comes  all the family    lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket  but it was impossible to be there while the wood sawyer was at work  and not be in his sight  thenceforth  to secure his good will  she always spoke to him first  and often gave him drink money  which he readily received   he was an inquisitive fellow  and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates  and in lifting her heart up to her husband  she would come to herself to find him looking at her  with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work   but it s not my business   he would generally say at those times  and would briskly fall to his sawing again   in all weathers  in the snow and frost of winter  in the bitter winds of spring  in the hot sunshine of summer  in the rains of autumn  and again in the snow and frost of winter  lucie passed two hours of every day at this place  and every day on leaving it  she kissed the prison wall  her husband saw her  so she learned from her father  it might be once in five or six times  it might be twice or thrice running  it might be  not for a week or a fortnight together  it was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served  and on that possibility she would have waited out the day  seven days a week   these occupations brought her round to the december month  wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head  on a lightly snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner  it was a day of some wild rejoicing  and a festival  she had seen the houses  as she came along  decorated with little pikes  and with little red caps stuck upon them  also  with tricoloured ribbons  also  with the standard inscription  tricoloured letters were the favourite   republic one and indivisible  liberty  equality  fraternity  or death   the miserable shop of the wood sawyer was so small  that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend  he had got somebody to scrawl it up for him  however  who had squeezed death in with most inappropriate difficulty  on his house top  he displayed pike and cap  as a good citizen must  and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his  little sainte guillotine   for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised  his shop was shut and he was not there  which was a relief to lucie  and left her quite alone   but  he was not far off  for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along  which filled her with fear  a moment afterwards  and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall  in the midst of whom was the wood sawyer hand in hand with the vengeance  there could not be fewer than five hundred people  and they were dancing like five thousand demons  there was no other music than their own singing  they danced to the popular revolution song  keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison  men and women danced together  women danced together  men danced together  as hazard had brought them together  at first  they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags  but  as they filled the place  and stopped to dance about lucie  some ghastly apparition of a dance figure gone raving mad arose among them  they advanced  retreated  struck at one another s hands  clutched at one another s heads  spun round alone  caught one another and spun round in pairs  until many of them dropped  while those were down  the rest linked hand in hand  and all spun round together  then the ring broke  and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once  began again  struck  clutched  and tore  and then reversed the spin  and all spun round another way  suddenly they stopped again  paused  struck out the time afresh  formed into lines the width of the public way  and  with their heads low down and their hands high up  swooped screaming off  no fight could have been half so terrible as this dance  it was so emphatically a fallen sport  a something  once innocent  delivered over to all devilry  a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood  bewildering the senses  and steeling the heart  such grace as was visible in it  made it the uglier  showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become  the maidenly bosom bared to this  the pretty almost child s head thus distracted  the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt  were types of the disjointed time   this was the carmagnole  as it passed  leaving lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the wood sawyer s house  the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft  as if it had never been    o my father   for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand   such a cruel  bad sight     i know  my dear  i know  i have seen it many times  don t be frightened  not one of them would harm you     i am not frightened for myself  my father  but when i think of my husband  and the mercies of these people      we will set him above their mercies very soon  i left him climbing to the window  and i came to tell you  there is no one here to see  you may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof     i do so  father  and i send him my soul with it     you cannot see him  my poor dear     no  father   said lucie  yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand   no    a footstep in the snow  madame defarge   i salute you  citizeness    from the doctor   i salute you  citizen   this in passing  nothing more  madame defarge gone  like a shadow over the white road    give me your arm  my love  pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage  for his sake  that was well done   they had left the spot   it shall not be in vain  charles is summoned for to morrow     for to morrow     there is no time to lose  i am well prepared  but there are precautions to be taken  that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the tribunal  he has not received the notice yet  but i know that he will presently be summoned for to morrow  and removed to the conciergerie  i have timely information  you are not afraid    she could scarcely answer   i trust in you     do so  implicitly  your suspense is nearly ended  my darling  he shall be restored to you within a few hours  i have encompassed him with every protection  i must see lorry    he stopped  there was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing  they both knew too well what it meant  one  two  three  three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow    i must see lorry   the doctor repeated  turning her another way   the staunch old gentleman was still in his trust  had never left it  he and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national  what he could save for the owners  he saved  no better man living to hold fast by what tellson s had in keeping  and to hold his peace   a murky red and yellow sky  and a rising mist from the seine  denoted the approach of darkness  it was almost dark when they arrived at the bank  the stately residence of monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted  above a heap of dust and ashes in the court  ran the letters  national property  republic one and indivisible  liberty  equality  fraternity  or death   who could that be with mr  lorry  the owner of the riding coat upon the chair  who must not be seen  from whom newly arrived  did he come out  agitated and surprised  to take his favourite in his arms  to whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words  when  raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued  he said   removed to the conciergerie  and summoned for to morrow       vi  triumph   the dread tribunal of five judges  public prosecutor  and determined jury  sat every day  their lists went forth every evening  and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners  the standard gaoler joke was   come out and listen to the evening paper  you inside there     charles evremonde  called darnay    so at last began the evening paper at la force   when a name was called  its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded  charles evremonde  called darnay  had reason to know the usage  he had seen hundreds pass away so   his bloated gaoler  who wore spectacles to read with  glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place  and went through the list  making a similar short pause at each name  there were twenty three names  but only twenty were responded to  for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten  and two had already been guillotined and forgotten  the list was read  in the vaulted chamber where darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival  every one of those had perished in the massacre  every human creature he had since cared for and parted with  had died on the scaffold   there were hurried words of farewell and kindness  but the parting was soon over  it was the incident of every day  and the society of la force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert  for that evening  they crowded to the grates and shed tears there  but  twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled  and the time was  at best  short to the lock up hour  when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night  the prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling  their ways arose out of the condition of the time  similarly  though with a subtle difference  a species of fervour or intoxication  known  without doubt  to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily  and to die by it  was not mere boastfulness  but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind  in seasons of pestilence  some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease  a terrible passing inclination to die of it  and all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts  only needing circumstances to evoke them   the passage to the conciergerie was short and dark  the night in its vermin haunted cells was long and cold  next day  fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before charles darnay s name was called  all the fifteen were condemned  and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half    charles evremonde  called darnay   was at length arraigned   his judges sat upon the bench in feathered hats  but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head dress otherwise prevailing  looking at the jury and the turbulent audience  he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed  and that the felons were trying the honest men  the lowest  cruelest  and worst populace of a city  never without its quantity of low  cruel  and bad  were the directing spirits of the scene  noisily commenting  applauding  disapproving  anticipating  and precipitating the result  without a check  of the men  the greater part were armed in various ways  of the women  some wore knives  some daggers  some ate and drank as they looked on  many knitted  among these last  was one  with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked  she was in a front row  by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the barrier  but whom he directly remembered as defarge  he noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear  and that she seemed to be his wife  but  what he most noticed in the two figures was  that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be  they never looked towards him  they seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination  and they looked at the jury  but at nothing else  under the president sat doctor manette  in his usual quiet dress  as well as the prisoner could see  he and mr  lorry were the only men there  unconnected with the tribunal  who wore their usual clothes  and had not assumed the coarse garb of the carmagnole   charles evremonde  called darnay  was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant  whose life was forfeit to the republic  under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of death  it was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to france  there he was  and there was the decree  he had been taken in france  and his head was demanded    take off his head   cried the audience   an enemy to the republic    the president rang his bell to silence those cries  and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in england   undoubtedly it was   was he not an emigrant then  what did he call himself   not an emigrant  he hoped  within the sense and spirit of the law   why not  the president desired to know   because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him  and a station that was distasteful to him  and had left his country  he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the tribunal was in use  to live by his own industry in england  rather than on the industry of the overladen people of france   what proof had he of this   he handed in the names of two witnesses  theophile gabelle  and alexandre manette   but he had married in england  the president reminded him   true  but not an english woman   a citizeness of france   yes  by birth   her name and family    lucie manette  only daughter of doctor manette  the good physician who sits there    this answer had a happy effect upon the audience  cries in exaltation of the well known good physician rent the hall  so capriciously were the people moved  that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before  as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him   on these few steps of his dangerous way  charles darnay had set his foot according to doctor manette s reiterated instructions  the same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him  and had prepared every inch of his road   the president asked  why had he returned to france when he did  and not sooner   he had not returned sooner  he replied  simply because he had no means of living in france  save those he had resigned  whereas  in england  he lived by giving instruction in the french language and literature  he had returned when he did  on the pressing and written entreaty of a french citizen  who represented that his life was endangered by his absence  he had come back  to save a citizen s life  and to bear his testimony  at whatever personal hazard  to the truth  was that criminal in the eyes of the republic   the populace cried enthusiastically   no   and the president rang his bell to quiet them  which it did not  for they continued to cry  no    until they left off  of their own will   the president required the name of that citizen  the accused explained that the citizen was his first witness  he also referred with confidence to the citizen s letter  which had been taken from him at the barrier  but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the president   the doctor had taken care that it should be there  had assured him that it would be there  and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read  citizen gabelle was called to confirm it  and did so  citizen gabelle hinted  with infinite delicacy and politeness  that in the pressure of business imposed on the tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the republic with which it had to deal  he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the abbaye  in fact  had rather passed out of the tribunal s patriotic remembrance  until three days ago  when he had been summoned before it  and had been set at liberty on the jury s declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered  as to himself  by the surrender of the citizen evremonde  called darnay   doctor manette was next questioned  his high personal popularity  and the clearness of his answers  made a great impression  but  as he proceeded  as he showed that the accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment  that  the accused had remained in england  always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile  that  so far from being in favour with the aristocrat government there  he had actually been tried for his life by it  as the foe of england and friend of the united states  as he brought these circumstances into view  with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness  the jury and the populace became one  at last  when he appealed by name to monsieur lorry  an english gentleman then and there present  who  like himself  had been a witness on that english trial and could corroborate his account of it  the jury declared that they had heard enough  and that they were ready with their votes if the president were content to receive them   at every vote  the jurymen voted aloud and individually   the populace set up a shout of applause  all the voices were in the prisoner s favour  and the president declared him free   then  began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness  or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy  or which they regarded as some set off against their swollen account of cruel rage  no man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable  it is probable  to a blending of all the three  with the second predominating  no sooner was the acquittal pronounced  than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time  and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him  that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion  none the less because he knew very well  that the very same people  carried by another current  would have rushed at him with the very same intensity  to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets   his removal  to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried  rescued him from these caresses for the moment  five were to be tried together  next  as enemies of the republic  forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed  so quick was the tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost  that these five came down to him before he left the place  condemned to die within twenty four hours  the first of them told him so  with the customary prison sign of death  a raised finger  and they all added in words   long live the republic    the five had had  it is true  no audience to lengthen their proceedings  for when he and doctor manette emerged from the gate  there was a great crowd about it  in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in court  except two  for which he looked in vain  on his coming out  the concourse made at him anew  weeping  embracing  and shouting  all by turns and all together  until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted  seemed to run mad  like the people on the shore   they put him into a great chair they had among them  and which they had taken either out of the court itself  or one of its rooms or passages  over the chair they had thrown a red flag  and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top  in this car of triumph  not even the doctor s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men s shoulders  with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him  and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces  that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion  and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the guillotine   in wild dreamlike procession  embracing whom they met and pointing him out  they carried him on  reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing republican colour  in winding and tramping through them  as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye  they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived  her father had gone on before  to prepare her  and when her husband stood upon his feet  she dropped insensible in his arms   as he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd  so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen  a few of the people fell to dancing  instantly  all the rest fell to dancing  and the courtyard overflowed with the carmagnole  then  they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the goddess of liberty  and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets  and along the river s bank  and over the bridge  the carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away   after grasping the doctor s hand  as he stood victorious and proud before him  after grasping the hand of mr  lorry  who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the carmagnole  after kissing little lucie  who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck  and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful pross who lifted her  he took his wife in his arms  and carried her up to their rooms    lucie  my own  i am safe     o dearest charles  let me thank god for this on my knees as i have prayed to him    they all reverently bowed their heads and hearts  when she was again in his arms  he said to her    and now speak to your father  dearest  no other man in all this france could have done what he has done for me    she laid her head upon her father s breast  as she had laid his poor head on her own breast  long  long ago  he was happy in the return he had made her  he was recompensed for his suffering  he was proud of his strength   you must not be weak  my darling   he remonstrated   don t tremble so  i have saved him       vii  a knock at the door    i have saved him   it was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back  he was really here  and yet his wife trembled  and a vague but heavy fear was upon her   all the air round was so thick and dark  the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful  the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice  it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her  every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched  that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be  the shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall  and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets  her mind pursued them  looking for him among the condemned  and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more   her father  cheering her  showed a compassionate superiority to this woman s weakness  which was wonderful to see  no garret  no shoemaking  no one hundred and five  north tower  now  he had accomplished the task he had set himself  his promise was redeemed  he had saved charles  let them all lean upon him   their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind  not only because that was the safest way of life  involving the least offence to the people  but because they were not rich  and charles  throughout his imprisonment  had had to pay heavily for his bad food  and for his guard  and towards the living of the poorer prisoners  partly on this account  and partly to avoid a domestic spy  they kept no servant  the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate  rendered them occasional service  and jerry  almost wholly transferred to them by mr  lorry  had become their daily retainer  and had his bed there every night   it was an ordinance of the republic one and indivisible of liberty  equality  fraternity  or death  that on the door or doorpost of every house  the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size  at a certain convenient height from the ground  mr  jerry cruncher s name  therefore  duly embellished the doorpost down below  and  as the afternoon shadows deepened  the owner of that name himself appeared  from overlooking a painter whom doctor manette had employed to add to the list the name of charles evremonde  called darnay   in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time  all the usual harmless ways of life were changed  in the doctor s little household  as in very many others  the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening  in small quantities and at various small shops  to avoid attracting notice  and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy  was the general desire   for some months past  miss pross and mr  cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors  the former carrying the money  the latter  the basket  every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted  they fared forth on this duty  and made and brought home such purchases as were needful  although miss pross  through her long association with a french family  might have known as much of their language as of her own  if she had had a mind  she had no mind in that direction  consequently she knew no more of that  nonsense   as she was pleased to call it  than mr  cruncher did  so her manner of marketing was to plump a noun substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article  and  if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted  to look round for that thing  lay hold of it  and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded  she always made a bargain for it  by holding up  as a statement of its just price  one finger less than the merchant held up  whatever his number might be    now  mr  cruncher   said miss pross  whose eyes were red with felicity   if you are ready  i am    jerry hoarsely professed himself at miss pross s service  he had worn all his rust off long ago  but nothing would file his spiky head down    there s all manner of things wanted   said miss pross   and we shall have a precious time of it  we want wine  among the rest  nice toasts these redheads will be drinking  wherever we buy it     it will be much the same to your knowledge  miss  i should think    retorted jerry   whether they drink your health or the old un s     who s he   said miss pross   mr  cruncher  with some diffidence  explained himself as meaning  old nick s     ha   said miss pross   it doesn t need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures  they have but one  and it s midnight murder  and mischief     hush  dear  pray  pray  be cautious   cried lucie    yes  yes  yes  i ll be cautious   said miss pross   but i may say among ourselves  that i do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round  going on in the streets  now  ladybird  never you stir from that fire till i come back  take care of the dear husband you have recovered  and don t move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now  till you see me again  may i ask a question  doctor manette  before i go     i think you may take that liberty   the doctor answered  smiling    for gracious sake  don t talk about liberty  we have quite enough of that   said miss pross    hush  dear  again   lucie remonstrated    well  my sweet   said miss pross  nodding her head emphatically   the short and the long of it is  that i am a subject of his most gracious majesty king george the third   miss pross curtseyed at the name   and as such  my maxim is  confound their politics  frustrate their knavish tricks  on him our hopes we fix  god save the king    mr  cruncher  in an access of loyalty  growlingly repeated the words after miss pross  like somebody at church    i am glad you have so much of the englishman in you  though i wish you had never taken that cold in your voice   said miss pross  approvingly   but the question  doctor manette  is there   it was the good creature s way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all  and to come at it in this chance manner   is there any prospect yet  of our getting out of this place     i fear not yet  it would be dangerous for charles yet     heigh ho hum   said miss pross  cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling s golden hair in the light of the fire   then we must have patience and wait  that s all  we must hold up our heads and fight low  as my brother solomon used to say  now  mr  cruncher   don t you move  ladybird    they went out  leaving lucie  and her husband  her father  and the child  by a bright fire  mr  lorry was expected back presently from the banking house  miss pross had lighted the lamp  but had put it aside in a corner  that they might enjoy the fire light undisturbed  little lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm  and he  in a tone not rising much above a whisper  began to tell her a story of a great and powerful fairy who had opened a prison wall and let out a captive who had once done the fairy a service  all was subdued and quiet  and lucie was more at ease than she had been    what is that   she cried  all at once    my dear   said her father  stopping in his story  and laying his hand on hers   command yourself  what a disordered state you are in  the least thing  nothing  startles you  you  your father s daughter     i thought  my father   said lucie  excusing herself  with a pale face and in a faltering voice   that i heard strange feet upon the stairs     my love  the staircase is as still as death    as he said the word  a blow was struck upon the door    oh father  father  what can this be  hide charles  save him     my child   said the doctor  rising  and laying his hand upon her shoulder   i have saved him  what weakness is this  my dear  let me go to the door    he took the lamp in his hand  crossed the two intervening outer rooms  and opened it  a rude clattering of feet over the floor  and four rough men in red caps  armed with sabres and pistols  entered the room    the citizen evremonde  called darnay   said the first    who seeks him   answered darnay    i seek him  we seek him  i know you  evremonde  i saw you before the tribunal to day  you are again the prisoner of the republic    the four surrounded him  where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him    tell me how and why am i again a prisoner     it is enough that you return straight to the conciergerie  and will know to morrow  you are summoned for to morrow    doctor manette  whom this visitation had so turned into stone  that he stood with the lamp in his hand  as if he were a statue made to hold it  moved after these words were spoken  put the lamp down  and confronting the speaker  and taking him  not ungently  by the loose front of his red woollen shirt  said    you know him  you have said  do you know me     yes  i know you  citizen doctor     we all know you  citizen doctor   said the other three   he looked abstractedly from one to another  and said  in a lower voice  after a pause    will you answer his question to me then  how does this happen     citizen doctor   said the first  reluctantly   he has been denounced to the section of saint antoine  this citizen   pointing out the second who had entered   is from saint antoine    the citizen here indicated nodded his head  and added    he is accused by saint antoine     of what   asked the doctor    citizen doctor   said the first  with his former reluctance   ask no more  if the republic demands sacrifices from you  without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them  the republic goes before all  the people is supreme  evremonde  we are pressed     one word   the doctor entreated   will you tell me who denounced him     it is against rule   answered the first   but you can ask him of saint antoine here    the doctor turned his eyes upon that man  who moved uneasily on his feet  rubbed his beard a little  and at length said    well  truly it is against rule  but he is denounced  and gravely  by the citizen and citizeness defarge  and by one other     what other     do you ask  citizen doctor     yes     then   said he of saint antoine  with a strange look   you will be answered to morrow  now  i am dumb       viii  a hand at cards   happily unconscious of the new calamity at home  miss pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the pont neuf  reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make  mr  cruncher  with the basket  walked at her side  they both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed  had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people  and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers  it was a raw evening  and the misty river  blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises  showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked  making guns for the army of the republic  woe to the man who played tricks with that army  or got undeserved promotion in it  better for him that his beard had never grown  for the national razor shaved him close   having purchased a few small articles of grocery  and a measure of oil for the lamp  miss pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted  after peeping into several wine shops  she stopped at the sign of the good republican brutus of antiquity  not far from the national palace  once  and twice  the tuileries  where the aspect of things rather took her fancy  it had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed  and  though red with patriotic caps  was not so red as the rest  sounding mr  cruncher  and finding him of her opinion  miss pross resorted to the good republican brutus of antiquity  attended by her cavalier   slightly observant of the smoky lights  of the people  pipe in mouth  playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes  of the one bare breasted  bare armed  soot begrimed workman reading a journal aloud  and of the others listening to him  of the weapons worn  or laid aside to be resumed  of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep  who in the popular high shouldered shaggy black spencer looked  in that attitude  like slumbering bears or dogs  the two outlandish customers approached the counter  and showed what they wanted   as their wine was measuring out  a man parted from another man in a corner  and rose to depart  in going  he had to face miss pross  no sooner did he face her  than miss pross uttered a scream  and clapped her hands   in a moment  the whole company were on their feet  that somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence  everybody looked to see somebody fall  but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other  the man with all the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thorough republican  the woman  evidently english   what was said in this disappointing anti climax  by the disciples of the good republican brutus of antiquity  except that it was something very voluble and loud  would have been as so much hebrew or chaldean to miss pross and her protector  though they had been all ears  but  they had no ears for anything in their surprise  for  it must be recorded  that not only was miss pross lost in amazement and agitation  but  mr  cruncher  though it seemed on his own separate and individual account  was in a state of the greatest wonder    what is the matter   said the man who had caused miss pross to scream  speaking in a vexed  abrupt voice  though in a low tone   and in english    oh  solomon  dear solomon   cried miss pross  clapping her hands again   after not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time  do i find you here     don t call me solomon  do you want to be the death of me   asked the man  in a furtive  frightened way    brother  brother   cried miss pross  bursting into tears   have i ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question     then hold your meddlesome tongue   said solomon   and come out  if you want to speak to me  pay for your wine  and come out  who s this man    miss pross  shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother  said through her tears   mr  cruncher     let him come out too   said solomon   does he think me a ghost    apparently  mr  cruncher did  to judge from his looks  he said not a word  however  and miss pross  exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine  as she did so  solomon turned to the followers of the good republican brutus of antiquity  and offered a few words of explanation in the french language  which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits    now   said solomon  stopping at the dark street corner   what do you want     how dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from   cried miss pross   to give me such a greeting  and show me no affection     there  confound it  there   said solomon  making a dab at miss pross s lips with his own   now are you content    miss pross only shook her head and wept in silence    if you expect me to be surprised   said her brother solomon   i am not surprised  i knew you were here  i know of most people who are here  if you really don t want to endanger my existence  which i half believe you do  go your ways as soon as possible  and let me go mine  i am busy  i am an official     my english brother solomon   mourned miss pross  casting up her tear fraught eyes   that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country  an official among foreigners  and such foreigners  i would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his      i said so   cried her brother  interrupting   i knew it  you want to be the death of me  i shall be rendered suspected  by my own sister  just as i am getting on     the gracious and merciful heavens forbid   cried miss pross   far rather would i never see you again  dear solomon  though i have ever loved you truly  and ever shall  say but one affectionate word to me  and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us  and i will detain you no longer    good miss pross  as if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers  as if mr  lorry had not known it for a fact  years ago  in the quiet corner in soho  that this precious brother had spent her money and left her   he was saying the affectionate word  however  with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed  which is invariably the case  all the world over   when mr  cruncher  touching him on the shoulder  hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question    i say  might i ask the favour  as to whether your name is john solomon  or solomon john    the official turned towards him with sudden distrust  he had not previously uttered a word    come   said mr  cruncher   speak out  you know    which  by the way  was more than he could do himself    john solomon  or solomon john  she calls you solomon  and she must know  being your sister  and i know you re john  you know  which of the two goes first  and regarding that name of pross  likewise  that warn t your name over the water     what do you mean     well  i don t know all i mean  for i can t call to mind what your name was  over the water     no     no  but i ll swear it was a name of two syllables     indeed     yes  t other one s was one syllable  i know you  you was a spy  witness at the bailey  what  in the name of the father of lies  own father to yourself  was you called at that time     barsad   said another voice  striking in    that s the name for a thousand pound   cried jerry   the speaker who struck in  was sydney carton  he had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding coat  and he stood at mr  cruncher s elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the old bailey itself    don t be alarmed  my dear miss pross  i arrived at mr  lorry s  to his surprise  yesterday evening  we agreed that i would not present myself elsewhere until all was well  or unless i could be useful  i present myself here  to beg a little talk with your brother  i wish you had a better employed brother than mr  barsad  i wish for your sake mr  barsad was not a sheep of the prisons    sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy  under the gaolers  the spy  who was pale  turned paler  and asked him how he dared     i ll tell you   said sydney   i lighted on you  mr  barsad  coming out of the prison of the conciergerie while i was contemplating the walls  an hour or more ago  you have a face to be remembered  and i remember faces well  made curious by seeing you in that connection  and having a reason  to which you are no stranger  for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate  i walked in your direction  i walked into the wine shop here  close after you  and sat near you  i had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation  and the rumour openly going about among your admirers  the nature of your calling  and gradually  what i had done at random  seemed to shape itself into a purpose  mr  barsad     what purpose   the spy asked    it would be troublesome  and might be dangerous  to explain in the street  could you favour me  in confidence  with some minutes of your company  at the office of tellson s bank  for instance     under a threat     oh  did i say that     then  why should i go there     really  mr  barsad  i can t say  if you can t     do you mean that you won t say  sir   the spy irresolutely asked    you apprehend me very clearly  mr  barsad  i won t    carton s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill  in such a business as he had in his secret mind  and with such a man as he had to do with  his practised eye saw it  and made the most of it    now  i told you so   said the spy  casting a reproachful look at his sister   if any trouble comes of this  it s your doing     come  come  mr  barsad   exclaimed sydney   don t be ungrateful  but for my great respect for your sister  i might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make for our mutual satisfaction  do you go with me to the bank     i ll hear what you have got to say  yes  i ll go with you     i propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street  let me take your arm  miss pross  this is not a good city  at this time  for you to be out in  unprotected  and as your escort knows mr  barsad  i will invite him to mr  lorry s with us  are we ready  come then    miss pross recalled soon afterwards  and to the end of her life remembered  that as she pressed her hands on sydney s arm and looked up in his face  imploring him to do no hurt to solomon  there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes  which not only contradicted his light manner  but changed and raised the man  she was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection  and with sydney s friendly reassurances  adequately to heed what she observed   they left her at the corner of the street  and carton led the way to mr  lorry s  which was within a few minutes  walk  john barsad  or solomon pross  walked at his side   mr  lorry had just finished his dinner  and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire  perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from tellson s  who had looked into the red coals at the royal george at dover  now a good many years ago  he turned his head as they entered  and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger    miss pross s brother  sir   said sydney   mr  barsad     barsad   repeated the old gentleman   barsad  i have an association with the name  and with the face     i told you you had a remarkable face  mr  barsad   observed carton  coolly   pray sit down    as he took a chair himself  he supplied the link that mr  lorry wanted  by saying to him with a frown   witness at that trial   mr  lorry immediately remembered  and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence    mr  barsad has been recognised by miss pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of   said sydney   and has acknowledged the relationship  i pass to worse news  darnay has been arrested again    struck with consternation  the old gentleman exclaimed   what do you tell me  i left him safe and free within these two hours  and am about to return to him     arrested for all that  when was it done  mr  barsad     just now  if at all     mr  barsad is the best authority possible  sir   said sydney   and i have it from mr  barsad s communication to a friend and brother sheep over a bottle of wine  that the arrest has taken place  he left the messengers at the gate  and saw them admitted by the porter  there is no earthly doubt that he is retaken    mr  lorry s business eye read in the speaker s face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point  confused  but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind  he commanded himself  and was silently attentive    now  i trust   said sydney to him   that the name and influence of doctor manette may stand him in as good stead to morrow  you said he would be before the tribunal again to morrow  mr  barsad       yes  i believe so       in as good stead to morrow as to day  but it may not be so  i own to you  i am shaken  mr  lorry  by doctor manette s not having had the power to prevent this arrest     he may not have known of it beforehand   said mr  lorry    but that very circumstance would be alarming  when we remember how identified he is with his son in law     that s true   mr  lorry acknowledged  with his troubled hand at his chin  and his troubled eyes on carton    in short   said sydney   this is a desperate time  when desperate games are played for desperate stakes  let the doctor play the winning game  i will play the losing one  no man s life here is worth purchase  any one carried home by the people to day  may be condemned tomorrow  now  the stake i have resolved to play for  in case of the worst  is a friend in the conciergerie  and the friend i purpose to myself to win  is mr  barsad     you need have good cards  sir   said the spy    i ll run them over  i ll see what i hold   mr  lorry  you know what a brute i am  i wish you d give me a little brandy    it was put before him  and he drank off a glassful  drank off another glassful  pushed the bottle thoughtfully away    mr  barsad   he went on  in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards   sheep of the prisons  emissary of republican committees  now turnkey  now prisoner  always spy and secret informer  so much the more valuable here for being english that an englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a frenchman  represents himself to his employers under a false name  that s a very good card  mr  barsad  now in the employ of the republican french government  was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic english government  the enemy of france and freedom  that s an excellent card  inference clear as day in this region of suspicion  that mr  barsad  still in the pay of the aristocratic english government  is the spy of pitt  the treacherous foe of the republic crouching in its bosom  the english traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find  that s a card not to be beaten  have you followed my hand  mr  barsad     not to understand your play   returned the spy  somewhat uneasily    i play my ace  denunciation of mr  barsad to the nearest section committee  look over your hand  mr  barsad  and see what you have  don t hurry    he drew the bottle near  poured out another glassful of brandy  and drank it off  he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him  seeing it  he poured out and drank another glassful    look over your hand carefully  mr  barsad  take time    it was a poorer hand than he suspected  mr  barsad saw losing cards in it that sydney carton knew nothing of  thrown out of his honourable employment in england  through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there  not because he was not wanted there  our english reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date  he knew that he had crossed the channel  and accepted service in france  first  as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there  gradually  as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives  he knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon saint antoine and defarge s wine shop  had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning doctor manette s imprisonment  release  and history  as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the defarges  and tried them on madame defarge  and had broken down with them signally  he always remembered with fear and trembling  that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her  and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved  he had since seen her  in the section of saint antoine  over and over again produce her knitted registers  and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up  he knew  as every one employed as he was did  that he was never safe  that flight was impossible  that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe  and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror  a word might bring it down upon him  once denounced  and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind  he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs  would produce against him that fatal register  and would quash his last chance of life  besides that all secret men are men soon terrified  here were surely cards enough of one black suit  to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over    you scarcely seem to like your hand   said sydney  with the greatest composure   do you play     i think  sir   said the spy  in the meanest manner  as he turned to mr  lorry   i may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence  to put it to this other gentleman  so much your junior  whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that ace of which he has spoken  i admit that i am a spy  and that it is considered a discreditable station  though it must be filled by somebody  but this gentleman is no spy  and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one     i play my ace  mr  barsad   said carton  taking the answer on himself  and looking at his watch   without any scruple  in a very few minutes     i should have hoped  gentlemen both   said the spy  always striving to hook mr  lorry into the discussion   that your respect for my sister      i could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother   said sydney carton    you think not  sir     i have thoroughly made up my mind about it    the smooth manner of the spy  curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress  and probably with his usual demeanour  received such a check from the inscrutability of carton   who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he   that it faltered here and failed him  while he was at a loss  carton said  resuming his former air of contemplating cards    and indeed  now i think again  i have a strong impression that i have another good card here  not yet enumerated  that friend and fellow sheep  who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons  who was he     french  you don t know him   said the spy  quickly    french  eh   repeated carton  musing  and not appearing to notice him at all  though he echoed his word   well  he may be     is  i assure you   said the spy   though it s not important     though it s not important   repeated carton  in the same mechanical way   though it s not important  no  it s not important  no  yet i know the face     i think not  i am sure not  it can t be   said the spy    it can t be   muttered sydney carton  retrospectively  and idling his glass  which fortunately was a small one  again   can t be  spoke good french  yet like a foreigner  i thought     provincial   said the spy    no  foreign   cried carton  striking his open hand on the table  as a light broke clearly on his mind   cly  disguised  but the same man  we had that man before us at the old bailey     now  there you are hasty  sir   said barsad  with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side   there you really give me an advantage over you  cly  who i will unreservedly admit  at this distance of time  was a partner of mine  has been dead several years  i attended him in his last illness  he was buried in london  at the church of saint pancras in the fields  his unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains  but i helped to lay him in his coffin    here  mr  lorry became aware  from where he sat  of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall  tracing it to its source  he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on mr  cruncher s head    let us be reasonable   said the spy   and let us be fair  to show you how mistaken you are  and what an unfounded assumption yours is  i will lay before you a certificate of cly s burial  which i happened to have carried in my pocket book   with a hurried hand he produced and opened it   ever since  there it is  oh  look at it  look at it  you may take it in your hand  it s no forgery    here  mr  lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate  and mr  cruncher rose and stepped forward  his hair could not have been more violently on end  if it had been that moment dressed by the cow with the crumpled horn in the house that jack built   unseen by the spy  mr  cruncher stood at his side  and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff    that there roger cly  master   said mr  cruncher  with a taciturn and iron bound visage   so you put him in his coffin     i did     who took him out of it    barsad leaned back in his chair  and stammered   what do you mean     i mean   said mr  cruncher   that he warn t never in it  no  not he  i ll have my head took off  if he was ever in it    the spy looked round at the two gentlemen  they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at jerry    i tell you   said jerry   that you buried paving stones and earth in that there coffin  don t go and tell me that you buried cly  it was a take in  me and two more knows it     how do you know it     what s that to you  ecod   growled mr  cruncher   it s you i have got a old grudge again  is it  with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen  i d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea    sydney carton  who  with mr  lorry  had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business  here requested mr  cruncher to moderate and explain himself    at another time  sir   he returned  evasively   the present time is ill conwenient for explainin   what i stand to  is  that he knows well wot that there cly was never in that there coffin  let him say he was  in so much as a word of one syllable  and i ll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea   mr  cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer   or i ll out and announce him     humph  i see one thing   said carton   i hold another card  mr  barsad  impossible  here in raging paris  with suspicion filling the air  for you to outlive denunciation  when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself  who  moreover  has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again  a plot in the prisons  of the foreigner against the republic  a strong card  a certain guillotine card  do you play     no   returned the spy   i throw up  i confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob  that i only got away from england at the risk of being ducked to death  and that cly was so ferreted up and down  that he never would have got away at all but for that sham  though how this man knows it was a sham  is a wonder of wonders to me     never you trouble your head about this man   retorted the contentious mr  cruncher   you ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman  and look here  once more    mr  cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberality   i d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea    the sheep of the prisons turned from him to sydney carton  and said  with more decision   it has come to a point  i go on duty soon  and can t overstay my time  you told me you had a proposal  what is it  now  it is of no use asking too much of me  ask me to do anything in my office  putting my head in great extra danger  and i had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent  in short  i should make that choice  you talk of desperation  we are all desperate here  remember  i may denounce you if i think proper  and i can swear my way through stone walls  and so can others  now  what do you want with me     not very much  you are a turnkey at the conciergerie     i tell you once for all  there is no such thing as an escape possible    said the spy  firmly    why need you tell me what i have not asked  you are a turnkey at the conciergerie     i am sometimes     you can be when you choose     i can pass in and out when i choose    sydney carton filled another glass with brandy  poured it slowly out upon the hearth  and watched it as it dropped  it being all spent  he said  rising    so far  we have spoken before these two  because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me  come into the dark room here  and let us have one final word alone       ix  the game made   while sydney carton and the sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room  speaking so low that not a sound was heard  mr  lorry looked at jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust  that honest tradesman s manner of receiving the look  did not inspire confidence  he changed the leg on which he rested  as often as if he had fifty of those limbs  and were trying them all  he examined his finger nails with a very questionable closeness of attention  and whenever mr  lorry s eye caught his  he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it  which is seldom  if ever  known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character    jerry   said mr  lorry   come here    mr  cruncher came forward sideways  with one of his shoulders in advance of him    what have you been  besides a messenger    after some cogitation  accompanied with an intent look at his patron  mr  cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying   agicultooral character     my mind misgives me much   said mr  lorry  angrily shaking a forefinger at him   that you have used the respectable and great house of tellson s as a blind  and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description  if you have  don t expect me to befriend you when you get back to england  if you have  don t expect me to keep your secret  tellson s shall not be imposed upon     i hope  sir   pleaded the abashed mr  cruncher   that a gentleman like yourself wot i ve had the honour of odd jobbing till i m grey at it  would think twice about harming of me  even if it wos so  i don t say it is  but even if it wos  and which it is to be took into account that if it wos  it wouldn t  even then  be all o  one side  there d be two sides to it  there might be medical doctors at the present hour  a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman don t pick up his fardens  fardens  no  nor yet his half fardens  half fardens  no  nor yet his quarter  a banking away like smoke at tellson s  and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly  a going in and going out to their own carriages  ah  equally like smoke  if not more so  well  that  ud be imposing  too  on tellson s  for you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander  and here s mrs  cruncher  or leastways wos in the old england times  and would be to morrow  if cause given  a floppin  again the business to that degree as is ruinating  stark ruinating  whereas them medical doctors  wives don t flop  catch  em at it  or  if they flop  their floppings goes in favour of more patients  and how can you rightly have one without t other  then  wot with undertakers  and wot with parish clerks  and wot with sextons  and wot with private watchmen  all awaricious and all in it   a man wouldn t get much by it  even if it wos so  and wot little a man did get  would never prosper with him  mr  lorry  he d never have no good of it  he d want all along to be out of the line  if he  could see his way out  being once in  even if it wos so     ugh   cried mr  lorry  rather relenting  nevertheless   i am shocked at the sight of you     now  what i would humbly offer to you  sir   pursued mr  cruncher   even if it wos so  which i don t say it is      don t prevaricate   said mr  lorry    no  i will not  sir   returned mr  crunches as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practice   which i don t say it is  wot i would humbly offer to you  sir  would be this  upon that there stool  at that there bar  sets that there boy of mine  brought up and growed up to be a man  wot will errand you  message you  general light job you  till your

diggin  of  em in with a will  and with conwictions respectin  the futur  keepin  of  em safe  that  mr  lorry   said mr  cruncher  wiping his forehead with his arm  as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse   is wot i would respectfully offer to you  sir  a man don t see all this here a goin  on dreadful round him  in the way of subjects without heads  dear me  plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that  without havin  his serious thoughts of things  and these here would be mine  if it wos so  entreatin  of you fur to bear in mind that wot i said just now  i up and said in the good cause when i might have kep  it back     that at least is true   said mr  lorry   say no more now  it may be that i shall yet stand your friend  if you deserve it  and repent in action  not in words  i want no more words    mr  cruncher knuckled his forehead  as sydney carton and the spy returned from the dark room   adieu  mr  barsad   said the former   our arrangement thus made  you have nothing to fear from me    he sat down in a chair on the hearth  over against mr  lorry  when they were alone  mr  lorry asked him what he had done    not much  if it should go ill with the prisoner  i have ensured access to him  once    mr  lorry s countenance fell    it is all i could do   said carton   to propose too much  would be to put this man s head under the axe  and  as he himself said  nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced  it was obviously the weakness of the position  there is no help for it     but access to him   said mr  lorry   if it should go ill before the tribunal  will not save him     i never said it would    mr  lorry s eyes gradually sought the fire  his sympathy with his darling  and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest  gradually weakened them  he was an old man now  overborne with anxiety of late  and his tears fell    you are a good man and a true friend   said carton  in an altered voice   forgive me if i notice that you are affected  i could not see my father weep  and sit by  careless  and i could not respect your sorrow more  if you were my father  you are free from that misfortune  however    though he said the last words  with a slip into his usual manner  there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch  that mr  lorry  who had never seen the better side of him  was wholly unprepared for  he gave him his hand  and carton gently pressed it    to return to poor darnay   said carton   don t tell her of this interview  or this arrangement  it would not enable her to go to see him  she might think it was contrived  in case of the worse  to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence    mr  lorry had not thought of that  and he looked quickly at carton to see if it were in his mind  it seemed to be  he returned the look  and evidently understood it    she might think a thousand things   carton said   and any of them would only add to her trouble  don t speak of me to her  as i said to you when i first came  i had better not see her  i can put my hand out  to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do  without that  you are going to her  i hope  she must be very desolate to night     i am going now  directly     i am glad of that  she has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you  how does she look     anxious and unhappy  but very beautiful     ah    it was a long  grieving sound  like a sigh  almost like a sob  it attracted mr  lorry s eyes to carton s face  which was turned to the fire  a light  or a shade  the old gentleman could not have said which   passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill side on a wild bright day  and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs  which was tumbling forward  he wore the white riding coat and top boots  then in vogue  and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale  with his long brown hair  all untrimmed  hanging loose about him  his indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from mr  lorry  his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log  when it had broken under the weight of his foot    i forgot it   he said   mr  lorry s eyes were again attracted to his face  taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features  and having the expression of prisoners  faces fresh in his mind  he was strongly reminded of that expression    and your duties here have drawn to an end  sir   said carton  turning to him    yes  as i was telling you last night when lucie came in so unexpectedly  i have at length done all that i can do here  i hoped to have left them in perfect safety  and then to have quitted paris  i have my leave to pass  i was ready to go    they were both silent    yours is a long life to look back upon  sir   said carton  wistfully    i am in my seventy eighth year     you have been useful all your life  steadily and constantly occupied  trusted  respected  and looked up to     i have been a man of business  ever since i have been a man  indeed  i may say that i was a man of business when a boy     see what a place you fill at seventy eight  how many people will miss you when you leave it empty     a solitary old bachelor   answered mr  lorry  shaking his head   there is nobody to weep for me     how can you say that  wouldn t she weep for you  wouldn t her child     yes  yes  thank god  i didn t quite mean what i said     it is a thing to thank god for  is it not     surely  surely     if you could say  with truth  to your own solitary heart  to night   i have secured to myself the love and attachment  the gratitude or respect  of no human creature  i have won myself a tender place in no regard  i have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by   your seventy eight years would be seventy eight heavy curses  would they not     you say truly  mr  carton  i think they would be    sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire  and  after a silence of a few moments  said    i should like to ask you   does your childhood seem far off  do the days when you sat at your mother s knee  seem days of very long ago    responding to his softened manner  mr  lorry answered    twenty years back  yes  at this time of my life  no  for  as i draw closer and closer to the end  i travel in the circle  nearer and nearer to the beginning  it seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way  my heart is touched now  by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep  of my pretty young mother  and i so old    and by many associations of the days when what we call the world was not so real with me  and my faults were not confirmed in me     i understand the feeling   exclaimed carton  with a bright flush   and you are the better for it     i hope so    carton terminated the conversation here  by rising to help him on with his outer coat   but you   said mr  lorry  reverting to the theme   you are young     yes   said carton   i am not old  but my young way was never the way to age  enough of me     and of me  i am sure   said mr  lorry   are you going out     i ll walk with you to her gate  you know my vagabond and restless habits  if i should prowl about the streets a long time  don t be uneasy  i shall reappear in the morning  you go to the court to morrow     yes  unhappily     i shall be there  but only as one of the crowd  my spy will find a place for me  take my arm  sir    mr  lorry did so  and they went down stairs and out in the streets  a few minutes brought them to mr  lorry s destination  carton left him there  but lingered at a little distance  and turned back to the gate again when it was shut  and touched it  he had heard of her going to the prison every day   she came out here   he said  looking about him   turned this way  must have trod on these stones often  let me follow in her steps    it was ten o clock at night when he stood before the prison of la force  where she had stood hundreds of times  a little wood sawyer  having closed his shop  was smoking his pipe at his shop door    good night  citizen   said sydney carton  pausing in going by  for  the man eyed him inquisitively    good night  citizen     how goes the republic     you mean the guillotine  not ill  sixty three to day  we shall mount to a hundred soon  samson and his men complain sometimes  of being exhausted  ha  ha  ha  he is so droll  that samson  such a barber     do you often go to see him      shave  always  every day  what a barber  you have seen him at work     never     go and see him when he has a good batch  figure this to yourself  citizen  he shaved the sixty three to day  in less than two pipes  less than two pipes  word of honour    as the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking  to explain how he timed the executioner  carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him  that he turned away    but you are not english   said the wood sawyer   though you wear english dress     yes   said carton  pausing again  and answering over his shoulder    you speak like a frenchman     i am an old student here     aha  a perfect frenchman  good night  englishman     good night  citizen     but go and see that droll dog   the little man persisted  calling after him   and take a pipe with you    sydney had not gone far out of sight  when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp  and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper  then  traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way well  several dark and dirty streets  much dirtier than usual  for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of terror  he stopped at a chemist s shop  which the owner was closing with his own hands  a small  dim  crooked shop  kept in a tortuous  up hill thoroughfare  by a small  dim  crooked man   giving this citizen  too  good night  as he confronted him at his counter  he laid the scrap of paper before him   whew   the chemist whistled softly  as he read it   hi  hi  hi    sydney carton took no heed  and the chemist said    for you  citizen     for me     you will be careful to keep them separate  citizen  you know the consequences of mixing them     perfectly    certain small packets were made and given to him  he put them  one by one  in the breast of his inner coat  counted out the money for them  and deliberately left the shop   there is nothing more to do   said he  glancing upward at the moon   until to morrow  i can t sleep    it was not a reckless manner  the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fast sailing clouds  nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance  it was the settled manner of a tired man  who had wandered and struggled and got lost  but who at length struck into his road and saw its end   long ago  when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a youth of great promise  he had followed his father to the grave  his mother had died  years before  these solemn words  which had been read at his father s grave  arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets  among the heavy shadows  with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him   i am the resurrection and the life  saith the lord  he that believeth in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live  and whosoever liveth and believeth in me  shall never die    in a city dominated by the axe  alone at night  with natural sorrow rising in him for the sixty three who had been that day put to death  and for to morrow s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons  and still of to morrow s and to morrow s  the chain of association that brought the words home  like a rusty old ship s anchor from the deep  might have been easily found  he did not seek it  but repeated them and went on   with a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest  forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them  in the towers of the churches  where no prayers were said  for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of self destruction from years of priestly impostors  plunderers  and profligates  in the distant burial places  reserved  as they wrote upon the gates  for eternal sleep  in the abounding gaols  and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material  that no sorrowful story of a haunting spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the guillotine  with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury  sydney carton crossed the seine again for the lighter streets   few coaches were abroad  for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected  and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps  and put on heavy shoes  and trudged  but  the theatres were all well filled  and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed  and went chatting home  at one of the theatre doors  there was a little girl with a mother  looking for a way across the street through the mud  he carried the child over  and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss    i am the resurrection and the life  saith the lord  he that believeth in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live  and whosoever liveth and believeth in me  shall never die    now  that the streets were quiet  and the night wore on  the words were in the echoes of his feet  and were in the air  perfectly calm and steady  he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked  but  he heard them always   the night wore out  and  as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river walls of the island of paris  where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon  the day came coldly  looking like a dead face out of the sky  then  the night  with the moon and the stars  turned pale and died  and for a little while it seemed as if creation were delivered over to death s dominion   but  the glorious sun  rising  seemed to strike those words  that burden of the night  straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays  and looking along them  with reverently shaded eyes  a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him and the sun  while the river sparkled under it   the strong tide  so swift  so deep  and certain  was like a congenial friend  in the morning stillness  he walked by the stream  far from the houses  and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank  when he awoke and was afoot again  he lingered there yet a little longer  watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless  until the stream absorbed it  and carried it on to the sea    like me    a trading boat  with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf  then glided into his view  floated by him  and died away  as its silent track in the water disappeared  the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors  ended in the words   i am the resurrection and the life    mr  lorry was already out when he got back  and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone  sydney carton drank nothing but a little coffee  ate some bread  and  having washed and changed to refresh himself  went out to the place of trial   the court was all astir and a buzz  when the black sheep  whom many fell away from in dread  pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd  mr  lorry was there  and doctor manette was there  she was there  sitting beside her father   when her husband was brought in  she turned a look upon him  so sustaining  so encouraging  so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness  yet so courageous for his sake  that it called the healthy blood into his face  brightened his glance  and animated his heart  if there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look  on sydney carton  it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly   before that unjust tribunal  there was little or no order of procedure  ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing  there could have been no such revolution  if all laws  forms  and ceremonies  had not first been so monstrously abused  that the suicidal vengeance of the revolution was to scatter them all to the winds   every eye was turned to the jury  the same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before  and to morrow and the day after  eager and prominent among them  one man with a craving face  and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips  whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators  a life thirsting  cannibal looking  bloody minded juryman  the jacques three of st  antoine  the whole jury  as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer   every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor  no favourable leaning in that quarter to day  a fell  uncompromising  murderous business meaning there  every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd  and gleamed at it approvingly  and heads nodded at one another  before bending forward with a strained attention   charles evremonde  called darnay  released yesterday  reaccused and retaken yesterday  indictment delivered to him last night  suspected and denounced enemy of the republic  aristocrat  one of a family of tyrants  one of a race proscribed  for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people  charles evremonde  called darnay  in right of such proscription  absolutely dead in law   to this effect  in as few or fewer words  the public prosecutor   the president asked  was the accused openly denounced or secretly    openly  president     by whom     three voices  ernest defarge  wine vendor of st  antoine     good     therese defarge  his wife     good     alexandre manette  physician    a great uproar took place in the court  and in the midst of it  doctor manette was seen  pale and trembling  standing where he had been seated    president  i indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud  you know the accused to be the husband of my daughter  my daughter  and those dear to her  are far dearer to me than my life  who and where is the false conspirator who says that i denounce the husband of my child     citizen manette  be tranquil  to fail in submission to the authority of the tribunal would be to put yourself out of law  as to what is dearer to you than life  nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the republic    loud acclamations hailed this rebuke  the president rang his bell  and with warmth resumed    if the republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself  you would have no duty but to sacrifice her  listen to what is to follow  in the meanwhile  be silent    frantic acclamations were again raised  doctor manette sat down  with his eyes looking around  and his lips trembling  his daughter drew closer to him  the craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together  and restored the usual hand to his mouth   defarge was produced  when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard  and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment  and of his having been a mere boy in the doctor s service  and of the release  and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him  this short examination followed  for the court was quick with its work    you did good service at the taking of the bastille  citizen     i believe so    here  an excited woman screeched from the crowd   you were one of the best patriots there  why not say so  you were a cannonier that day there  and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell  patriots  i speak the truth    it was the vengeance who  amidst the warm commendations of the audience  thus assisted the proceedings  the president rang his bell  but  the vengeance  warming with encouragement  shrieked   i defy that bell    wherein she was likewise much commended    inform the tribunal of what you did that day within the bastille  citizen     i knew   said defarge  looking down at his wife  who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised  looking steadily up at him   i knew that this prisoner  of whom i speak  had been confined in a cell known as one hundred and five  north tower  i knew it from himself  he knew himself by no other name than one hundred and five  north tower  when he made shoes under my care  as i serve my gun that day  i resolve  when the place shall fall  to examine that cell  it falls  i mount to the cell  with a fellow citizen who is one of the jury  directed by a gaoler  i examine it  very closely  in a hole in the chimney  where a stone has been worked out and replaced  i find a written paper  this is that written paper  i have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of doctor manette  this is the writing of doctor manette  i confide this paper  in the writing of doctor manette  to the hands of the president     let it be read    in a dead silence and stillness  the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife  his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father  doctor manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader  madame defarge never taking hers from the prisoner  defarge never taking his from his feasting wife  and all the other eyes there intent upon the doctor  who saw none of them  the paper was read  as follows      x  the substance of the shadow    i  alexandre manette  unfortunate physician  native of beauvais  and afterwards resident in paris  write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the bastille  during the last month of the year    i write it at stolen intervals  under every difficulty  i design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney  where i have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it  some pitying hand may find it there  when i and my sorrows are dust    these words are formed by the rusty iron point with which i write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney  mixed with blood  in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity  hope has quite departed from my breast  i know from terrible warnings i have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired  but i solemnly declare that i am at this time in the possession of my right mind  that my memory is exact and circumstantial  and that i write the truth as i shall answer for these my last recorded words  whether they be ever read by men or not  at the eternal judgment seat    one cloudy moonlight night  in the third week of december  i think the twenty second of the month  in the year   i was walking on a retired part of the quay by the seine for the refreshment of the frosty air  at an hour s distance from my place of residence in the street of the school of medicine  when a carriage came along behind me  driven very fast  as i stood aside to let that carriage pass  apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down  a head was put out at the window  and a voice called to the driver to stop    the carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses  and the same voice called to me by my name  i answered  the carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before i came up with it    i observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks  and appeared to conceal themselves  as they stood side by side near the carriage door  i also observed that they both looked of about my own age  or rather younger  and that they were greatly alike  in stature  manner  voice  and  as far as i could see  face too     you are doctor manette   said one    i am      doctor manette  formerly of beauvais   said the other   the young physician  originally an expert surgeon  who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in paris      gentlemen   i returned   i am that doctor manette of whom you speak so graciously      we have been to your residence   said the first   and not being so fortunate as to find you there  and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction  we followed  in the hope of overtaking you  will you please to enter the carriage     the manner of both was imperious  and they both moved  as these words were spoken  so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door  they were armed  i was not     gentlemen   said i   pardon me  but i usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance  and what is the nature of the case to which i am summoned     the reply to this was made by him who had spoken second   doctor  your clients are people of condition  as to the nature of the case  our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it  enough  will you please to enter the carriage     i could do nothing but comply  and i entered it in silence  they both entered after me  the last springing in  after putting up the steps  the carriage turned about  and drove on at its former speed    i repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred  i have no doubt that it is  word for word  the same  i describe everything exactly as it took place  constraining my mind not to wander from the task  where i make the broken marks that follow here  i leave off for the time  and put my paper in its hiding place                   the carriage left the streets behind  passed the north barrier  and emerged upon the country road  at two thirds of a league from the barrier  i did not estimate the distance at that time  but afterwards when i traversed it  it struck out of the main avenue  and presently stopped at a solitary house  we all three alighted  and walked  by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed  to the door of the house  it was not opened immediately  in answer to the ringing of the bell  and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it  with his heavy riding glove  across the face    there was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention  for i had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs  but  the other of the two  being angry likewise  struck the man in like manner with his arm  the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike  that i then first perceived them to be twin brothers    from the time of our alighting at the outer gate  which we found locked  and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us  and had relocked   i had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber  i was conducted to this chamber straight  the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs  and i found a patient in a high fever of the brain  lying on a bed    the patient was a woman of great beauty  and young  assuredly not much past twenty  her hair was torn and ragged  and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs  i noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentleman s dress  on one of them  which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony  i saw the armorial bearings of a noble  and the letter e    i saw this  within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient  for  in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed  had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth  and was in danger of suffocation  my first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing  and in moving the scarf aside  the embroidery in the corner caught my sight    i turned her gently over  placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down  and looked into her face  her eyes were dilated and wild  and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks  and repeated the words   my husband  my father  and my brother   and then counted up to twelve  and said   hush   for an instant  and no more  she would pause to listen  and then the piercing shrieks would begin again  and she would repeat the cry   my husband  my father  and my brother   and would count up to twelve  and say   hush   there was no variation in the order  or the manner  there was no cessation  but the regular moment s pause  in the utterance of these sounds     how long   i asked   has this lasted     to distinguish the brothers  i will call them the elder and the younger  by the elder  i mean him who exercised the most authority  it was the elder who replied   since about this hour last night      she has a husband  a father  and a brother      a brother      i do not address her brother     he answered with great contempt   no      she has some recent association with the number twelve     the younger brother impatiently rejoined   with twelve o clock      see  gentlemen   said i  still keeping my hands upon her breast   how useless i am  as you have brought me  if i had known what i was coming to see  i could have come provided  as it is  time must be lost  there are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place     the elder brother looked to the younger  who said haughtily   there is a case of medicines here   and brought it from a closet  and put it on the table                   i opened some of the bottles  smelt them  and put the stoppers to my lips  if i had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves  i would not have administered any of those     do you doubt them   asked the younger brother     you see  monsieur  i am going to use them   i replied  and said no more    i made the patient swallow  with great difficulty  and after many efforts  the dose that i desired to give  as i intended to repeat it after a while  and as it was necessary to watch its influence  i then sat down by the side of the bed  there was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance  wife of the man down stairs   who had retreated into a corner  the house was damp and decayed  indifferently furnished  evidently  recently occupied and temporarily used  some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows  to deaden the sound of the shrieks  they continued to be uttered in their regular succession  with the cry   my husband  my father  and my brother   the counting up to twelve  and  hush   the frenzy was so violent  that i had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms  but  i had looked to them  to see that they were not painful  the only spark of encouragement in the case  was  that my hand upon the sufferer s breast had this much soothing influence  that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure  it had no effect upon the cries  no pendulum could be more regular    for the reason that my hand had this effect  i assume   i had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour  with the two brothers looking on  before the elder said     there is another patient     i was startled  and asked   is it a pressing case      you had better see   he carelessly answered  and took up a light                   the other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase  which was a species of loft over a stable  there was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it  the rest was open  to the ridge of the tiled roof  and there were beams across  hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place  fagots for firing  and a heap of apples in sand  i had to pass through that part  to get at the other  my memory is circumstantial and unshaken  i try it with these details  and i see them all  in this my cell in the bastille  near the close of the tenth year of my captivity  as i saw them all that night    on some hay on the ground  with a cushion thrown under his head  lay a handsome peasant boy  a boy of not more than seventeen at the most  he lay on his back  with his teeth set  his right hand clenched on his breast  and his glaring eyes looking straight upward  i could not see where his wound was  as i kneeled on one knee over him  but  i could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point     i am a doctor  my poor fellow   said i   let me examine it      i do not want it examined   he answered   let it be     it was under his hand  and i soothed him to let me move his hand away  the wound was a sword thrust  received from twenty to twenty four hours before  but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay  he was then dying fast  as i turned my eyes to the elder brother  i saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out  as if he were a wounded bird  or hare  or rabbit  not at all as if he were a fellow creature     how has this been done  monsieur   said i     a crazed young common dog  a serf  forced my brother to draw upon him  and has fallen by my brother s sword  like a gentleman     there was no touch of pity  sorrow  or kindred humanity  in this answer  the speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there  and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind  he was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy  or about his fate    the boy s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken  and they now slowly moved to me     doctor  they are very proud  these nobles  but we common dogs are proud too  sometimes  they plunder us  outrage us  beat us  kill us  but we have a little pride left  sometimes  she  have you seen her  doctor     the shrieks and the cries were audible there  though subdued by the distance  he referred to them  as if she were lying in our presence    i said   i have seen her      she is my sister  doctor  they have had their shameful rights  these nobles  in the modesty and virtue of our sisters  many years  but we have had good girls among us  i know it  and have heard my father say so  she was a good girl  she was betrothed to a good young man  too  a tenant of his  we were all tenants of his  that man s who stands there  the other is his brother  the worst of a bad race     it was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak  but  his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis     we were so robbed by that man who stands there  as all we common dogs are by those superior beings  taxed by him without mercy  obliged to work for him without pay  obliged to grind our corn at his mill  obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops  and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own  pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat  we ate it in fear  with the door barred and the shutters closed  that his people should not see it and take it from us  i say  we were so robbed  and hunted  and were made so poor  that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world  and that what we should most pray for  was  that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out     i had never before seen the sense of being oppressed  bursting forth like a fire  i had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere  but  i had never seen it break out  until i saw it in the dying boy     nevertheless  doctor  my sister married  he was ailing at that time  poor fellow  and she married her lover  that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage  our dog hut  as that man would call it  she had not been married many weeks  when that man s brother saw her and admired her  and asked that man to lend her to him  for what are husbands among us  he was willing enough  but my sister was good and virtuous  and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine  what did the two then  to persuade her husband to use his influence with her  to make her willing     the boy s eyes  which had been fixed on mine  slowly turned to the looker on  and i saw in the two faces that all he said was true  the two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another  i can see  even in this bastille  the gentleman s  all negligent indifference  the peasant s  all trodden down sentiment  and passionate revenge     you know  doctor  that it is among the rights of these nobles to harness us common dogs to carts  and drive us  they so harnessed him and drove him  you know that it is among their rights to keep us in their grounds all night  quieting the frogs  in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed  they kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night  and ordered him back into his harness in the day  but he was not persuaded  no  taken out of harness one day at noon  to feed  if he could find food  he sobbed twelve times  once for every stroke of the bell  and died on her bosom     nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong  he forced back the gathering shadows of death  as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched  and to cover his wound     then  with that man s permission and even with his aid  his brother took her away  in spite of what i know she must have told his brother  and what that is  will not be long unknown to you  doctor  if it is now  his brother took her away  for his pleasure and diversion  for a little while  i saw her pass me on the road  when i took the tidings home  our father s heart burst  he never spoke one of the words that filled it  i took my young sister  for i have another  to a place beyond the reach of this man  and where  at least  she will never be his vassal  then  i tracked the brother here  and last night climbed in  a common dog  but sword in hand   where is the loft window  it was somewhere here     the room was darkening to his sight  the world was narrowing around him  i glanced about me  and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor  as if there had been a struggle     she heard me  and ran in  i told her not to come near us till he was dead  he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money  then struck at me with a whip  but i  though a common dog  so struck at him as to make him draw  let him break into as many pieces as he will  the sword that he stained with my common blood  he drew to defend himself  thrust at me with all his skill for his life     my glance had fallen  but a few moments before  on the fragments of a broken sword  lying among the hay  that weapon was a gentleman s  in another place  lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier s     now  lift me up  doctor  lift me up  where is he      he is not here   i said  supporting the boy  and thinking that he referred to the brother     he  proud as these nobles are  he is afraid to see me  where is the man who was here  turn my face to him     i did so  raising the boy s head against my knee  but  invested for the moment with extraordinary power  he raised himself completely  obliging me to rise too  or i could not have still supported him     marquis   said the boy  turned to him with his eyes opened wide  and his right hand raised   in the days when all these things are to be answered for  i summon you and yours  to the last of your bad race  to answer for them  i mark this cross of blood upon you  as a sign that i do it  in the days when all these things are to be answered for  i summon your brother  the worst of the bad race  to answer for them separately  i mark this cross of blood upon him  as a sign that i do it     twice  he put his hand to the wound in his breast  and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air  he stood for an instant with the finger yet raised  and as it dropped  he dropped with it  and i laid him down dead                   when i returned to the bedside of the young woman  i found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity  i knew that this might last for many hours  and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave    i repeated the medicines i had given her  and i sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced  she never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks  never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words  they were always  my husband  my father  and my brother  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten  eleven  twelve  hush     this lasted twenty six hours from the time when i first saw her  i had come and gone twice  and was again sitting by her  when she began to falter  i did what little could be done to assist that opportunity  and by and bye she sank into a lethargy  and lay like the dead    it was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last  after a long and fearful storm  i released her arms  and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn  it was then that i knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen  and it was then that i lost the little hope i had had of her     is she dead   asked the marquis  whom i will still describe as the elder brother  coming booted into the room from his horse     not dead   said i   but like to die      what strength there is in these common bodies   he said  looking down at her with some curiosity     there is prodigious strength   i answered him   in sorrow and despair     he first laughed at my words  and then frowned at them  he moved a chair with his foot near to mine  ordered the woman away  and said in a subdued voice     doctor  finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds  i recommended that your aid should be invited  your reputation is high  and  as a young man with your fortune to make  you are probably mindful of your interest  the things that you see here  are things to be seen  and not spoken of     i listened to the patient s breathing  and avoided answering     do you honour me with your attention  doctor      monsieur   said i   in my profession  the communications of patients are always received in confidence   i was guarded in my answer  for i was troubled in my mind with what i had heard and seen    her breathing was so difficult to trace  that i carefully tried the pulse and the heart  there was life  and no more  looking round as i resumed my seat  i found both the brothers intent upon me                   i write with so much difficulty  the cold is so severe  i am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness  that i must abridge this narrative  there is no confusion or failure in my memory  it can recall  and could detail  every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers    she lingered for a week  towards the last  i could understand some few syllables that she said to me  by placing my ear close to her lips  she asked me where she was  and i told her  who i was  and i told her  it was in vain that i asked her for her family name  she faintly shook her head upon the pillow  and kept her secret  as the boy had done    i had no opportunity of asking her any question  until i had told the brothers she was sinking fast  and could not live another day  until then  though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself  one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when i was there  but when it came to that  they seemed careless what communication i might hold with her  as if  the thought passed through my mind  i were dying too    i always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother s  as i call him  having crossed swords with a peasant  and that peasant a boy  the only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family  and was ridiculous  as often as i caught the younger brother s eyes  their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply  for knowing what i knew from the boy  he was smoother and more polite to me than the elder  but i saw this  i also saw that i was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder  too    my patient died  two hours before midnight  at a time  by my watch  answering almost to the minute when i had first seen her  i was alone with her  when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side  and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended    the brothers were waiting in a room down stairs  impatient to ride away  i had heard them  alone at the bedside  striking their boots with their riding whips  and loitering up and down     at last she is dead   said the elder  when i went in     she is dead   said i     i congratulate you  my brother   were his words as he turned round    he had before offered me money  which i had postponed taking  he now gave me a rouleau of gold  i took it from his hand  but laid it on the table  i had considered the question  and had resolved to accept nothing     pray excuse me   said i   under the circumstances  no     they exchanged looks  but bent their heads to me as i bent mine to them  and we parted without another word on either side                   i am weary  weary  weary  worn down by misery  i cannot read what i have written with this gaunt hand    early in the morning  the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box  with my name on the outside  from the first  i had anxiously considered what i ought to do  i decided  that day  to write privately to the minister  stating the nature of the two cases to which i had been summoned  and the place to which i had gone  in effect  stating all the circumstances  i knew what court influence was  and what the immunities of the nobles were  and i expected that the matter would never be heard of  but  i wished to relieve my own mind  i had kept the matter a profound secret  even from my wife  and this  too  i resolved to state in my letter  i had no apprehension whatever of my real danger  but i was conscious that there might be danger for others  if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that i possessed    i was much engaged that day  and could not complete my letter that night  i rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it  it was the last day of the year  the letter was lying before me just completed  when i was told that a lady waited  who wished to see me                   i am growing more and more unequal to the task i have set myself  it is so cold  so dark  my senses are so benumbed  and the gloom upon me is so dreadful    the lady was young  engaging  and handsome  but not marked for long life  she was in great agitation  she presented herself to me as the wife of the marquis st  evremonde  i connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother  with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf  and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that i had seen that nobleman very lately    my memory is still accurate  but i cannot write the words of our conversation  i suspect that i am watched more closely than i was  and i know not at what times i may be watched  she had in part suspected  and in part discovered  the main facts of the cruel story  of her husband s share in it  and my being resorted to  she did not know that the girl was dead  her hope had been  she said in great distress  to show her  in secret  a woman s sympathy  her hope had been to avert the wrath of heaven from a house that had long been hateful to the suffering many    she had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living  and her greatest desire was  to help that sister  i could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister  beyond that  i knew nothing  her inducement to come to me  relying on my confidence  had been the hope that i could tell her the name and place of abode  whereas  to this wretched hour i am ignorant of both                   these scraps of paper fail me  one was taken from me  with a warning  yesterday  i must finish my record to day    she was a good  compassionate lady  and not happy in her marriage  how could she be  the brother distrusted and disliked her  and his influence was all opposed to her  she stood in dread of him  and in dread of her husband too  when i handed her down to the door  there was a child  a pretty boy from two to three years old  in her carriage     for his sake  doctor   she said  pointing to him in tears   i would do all i can to make what poor amends i can  he will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise  i have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this  it will one day be required of him  what i have left to call my own  it is little beyond the worth of a few jewels  i will make it the first charge of his life to bestow  with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother  on this injured family  if the sister can be discovered     she kissed the boy  and said  caressing him   it is for thine own dear sake  thou wilt be faithful  little charles   the child answered her bravely   yes   i kissed her hand  and she took him in her arms  and went away caressing him  i never saw her more    as she had mentioned her husband s name in the faith that i knew it  i added no mention of it to my letter  i sealed my letter  and  not trusting it out of my own hands  delivered it myself that day    that night  the last night of the year  towards nine o clock  a man in a black dress rang at my gate  demanded to see me  and softly followed my servant  ernest defarge  a youth  up stairs  when my servant came into the room where i sat with my wife  o my wife  beloved of my heart  my fair young english wife   we saw the man  who was supposed to be at the gate  standing silent behind him    an urgent case in the rue st  honore  he said  it would not detain me  he had a coach in waiting    it brought me here  it brought me to my grave  when i was clear of the house  a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind  and my arms were pinioned  the two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner  and identified me with a single gesture  the marquis took from his pocket the letter i had written  showed it me  burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held  and extinguished the ashes with his foot  not a word was spoken  i was brought here  i was brought to my living grave    if it had pleased god to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers  in all these frightful years  to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife  so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead  i might have thought that he had not quite abandoned them  but  now i believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them  and that they have no part in his mercies  and them and their descendants  to the last of their race  i  alexandre manette  unhappy prisoner  do this last night of the year   in my unbearable agony  denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for  i denounce them to heaven and to earth    a terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done  a sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood  the narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time  and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it   little need  in presence of that tribunal and that auditory  to show how the defarges had not made the paper public  with the other captured bastille memorials borne in procession  and had kept it  biding their time  little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by saint antoine  and was wrought into the fatal register  the man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day  against such denunciation   and all the worse for the doomed man  that the denouncer was a well known citizen  his own attached friend  the father of his wife  one of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was  for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity  and for sacrifices and self immolations on the people s altar  therefore when the president said  else had his own head quivered on his shoulders   that the good physician of the republic would deserve better still of the republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of aristocrats  and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan  there was wild excitement  patriotic fervour  not a touch of human sympathy    much influence around him  has that doctor   murmured madame defarge  smiling to the vengeance   save him now  my doctor  save him    at every juryman s vote  there was a roar  another and another  roar and roar   unanimously voted  at heart and by descent an aristocrat  an enemy of the republic  a notorious oppressor of the people  back to the conciergerie  and death within four and twenty hours      xi  dusk   the wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die  fell under the sentence  as if she had been mortally stricken  but  she uttered no sound  and so strong was the voice within her  representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it  that it quickly raised her  even from that shock   the judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors  the tribunal adjourned  the quick noise and movement of the court s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased  when lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband  with nothing in her face but love and consolation    if i might touch him  if i might embrace him once  o  good citizens  if you would have so much compassion for us    there was but a gaoler left  along with two of the four men who had taken him last night  and barsad  the people had all poured out to the show in the streets  barsad proposed to the rest   let her embrace him then  it is but a moment   it was silently acquiesced in  and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place  where he  by leaning over the dock  could fold her in his arms    farewell  dear darling of my soul  my parting blessing on my love  we shall meet again  where the weary are at rest    they were her husband s words  as he held her to his bosom    i can bear it  dear charles  i am supported from above  don t suffer for me  a parting blessing for our child     i send it to her by you  i kiss her by you  i say farewell to her by you     my husband  no  a moment   he was tearing himself apart from her   we shall not be separated long  i feel that this will break my heart by and bye  but i will do my duty while i can  and when i leave her  god will raise up friends for her  as he did for me    her father had followed her  and would have fallen on his knees to both of them  but that darnay put out a hand and seized him  crying    no  no  what have you done  what have you done  that you should kneel to us  we know now  what a struggle you made of old  we know  now what you underwent when you suspected my descent  and when you knew it  we know now  the natural antipathy you strove against  and conquered  for her dear sake  we thank you with all our hearts  and all our love and duty  heaven be with you    her father s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair  and wring them with a shriek of anguish    it could not be otherwise   said the prisoner   all things have worked together as they have fallen out  it was the always vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother s trust that first brought my fatal presence near you  good could never come of such evil  a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning  be comforted  and forgive me  heaven bless you    as he was drawn away  his wife released him  and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer  and with a radiant look upon her face  in which there was even a comforting smile  as he went out at the prisoners  door  she turned  laid her head lovingly on her father s breast  tried to speak to him  and fell at his feet   then  issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved  sydney carton came and took her up  only her father and mr  lorry were with her  his arm trembled as it raised her  and supported her head  yet  there was an air about him that was not all of pity  that had a flush of pride in it    shall i take her to a coach  i shall never feel her weight    he carried her lightly to the door  and laid her tenderly down in a coach  her father and their old friend got into it  and he took his seat beside the driver   when they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before  to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden  he lifted her again  and carried her up the staircase to their rooms  there  he laid her down on a couch  where her child and miss pross wept over her    don t recall her to herself   he said  softly  to the latter   she is better so  don t revive her to consciousness  while she only faints     oh  carton  carton  dear carton   cried little lucie  springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him  in a burst of grief   now that you have come  i think you will do something to help mamma  something to save papa  o  look at her  dear carton  can you  of all the people who love her  bear to see her so    he bent over the child  and laid her blooming cheek against his face  he put her gently from him  and looked at her unconscious mother    before i go   he said  and paused   i may kiss her    it was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips  he murmured some words  the child  who was nearest to him  told them afterwards  and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady  that she heard him say   a life you love    when he had gone out into the next room  he turned suddenly on mr  lorry and her father  who were following  and said to the latter    you had great influence but yesterday  doctor manette  let it at least be tried  these judges  and all the men in power  are very friendly to you  and very recognisant of your services  are they not     nothing connected with charles was concealed from me  i had the strongest assurances that i should save him  and i did   he returned the answer in great trouble  and very slowly    try them again  the hours between this and to morrow afternoon are few and short  but try     i intend to try  i will not rest a moment     that s well  i have known such energy as yours do great things before now  though never   he added  with a smile and a sigh together   such great things as this  but try  of little worth as life is when we misuse it  it is worth that effort  it would cost nothing to lay down if it were not     i will go   said doctor manette   to the prosecutor and the president straight  and i will go to others whom it is better not to name  i will write too  and  but stay  there is a celebration in the streets  and no one will be accessible until dark     that s true  well  it is a forlorn hope at the best  and not much the forlorner for being delayed till dark  i should like to know how you speed  though  mind  i expect nothing  when are you likely to have seen these dread powers  doctor manette     immediately after dark  i should hope  within an hour or two from this     it will be dark soon after four  let us stretch the hour or two  if i go to mr  lorry s at nine  shall i hear what you have done  either from our friend or from yourself     yes     may you prosper    mr  lorry followed sydney to the outer door  and  touching him on the shoulder as he was going away  caused him to turn    i have no hope   said mr  lorry  in a low and sorrowful whisper    nor have i     if any one of these men  or all of these men  were disposed to spare him  which is a large supposition  for what is his life  or any man s to them   i doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court     and so do i  i heard the fall of the axe in that sound    mr  lorry leaned his arm upon the door post  and bowed his face upon it    don t despond   said carton  very gently   don t grieve  i encouraged doctor manette in this idea  because i felt that it might one day be consolatory to her  otherwise  she might think  his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted   and that might trouble her     yes  yes  yes   returned mr  lorry  drying his eyes   you are right  but he will perish  there is no real hope     yes  he will perish  there is no real hope   echoed carton   and walked with a settled step  down stairs      xii  darkness   sydney carton paused in the street  not quite decided where to go   at tellson s banking house at nine   he said  with a musing face   shall i do well  in the mean time  to show myself  i think so  it is best that these people should know there is such a man as i here  it is a sound precaution  and may be a necessary preparation  but care  care  care  let me think it out    checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object  he took a turn or two in the already darkening street  and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences  his first impression was confirmed   it is best   he said  finally resolved   that these people should know there is such a man as i here   and he turned his face towards saint antoine   defarge had described himself  that day  as the keeper of a wine shop in the saint antoine suburb  it was not difficult for one who knew the city well  to find his house without asking any question  having ascertained its situation  carton came out of those closer streets again  and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner  for the first time in many years  he had no strong drink  since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine  and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on mr  lorry s hearth like a man who had done with it   it was as late as seven o clock when he awoke refreshed  and went out into the streets again  as he passed along towards saint antoine  he stopped at a shop window where there was a mirror  and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat  and his coat collar  and his wild hair  this done  he went on direct to defarge s  and went in   there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three  of the restless fingers and the croaking voice  this man  whom he had seen upon the jury  stood drinking at the little counter  in conversation with the defarges  man and wife  the vengeance assisted in the conversation  like a regular member of the establishment   as carton walked in  took his seat and asked  in very indifferent french  for a small measure of wine  madame defarge cast a careless glance at him  and then a keener  and then a keener  and then advanced to him herself  and asked him what it was he had ordered   he repeated what he had already said    english   asked madame defarge  inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows   after looking at her  as if the sound of even a single french word were slow to express itself to him  he answered  in his former strong foreign accent   yes  madame  yes  i am english    madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine  and  as he took up a jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning  he heard her say   i swear to you  like evremonde    defarge brought him the wine  and gave him good evening    how     good evening     oh  good evening  citizen   filling his glass   ah  and good wine  i drink to the republic    defarge went back to the counter  and said   certainly  a little like    madame sternly retorted   i tell you a good deal like   jacques three pacifically remarked   he is so much in your mind  see you  madame    the amiable vengeance added  with a laugh   yes  my faith  and you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more to morrow    carton followed the lines and words of his paper  with a slow forefinger  and with a studious and absorbed face  they were all leaning their arms on the counter close together  speaking low  after a silence of a few moments  during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the jacobin editor  they resumed their conversation    it is true what madame says   observed jacques three   why stop  there is great force in that  why stop     well  well   reasoned defarge   but one must stop somewhere  after all  the question is still where     at extermination   said madame    magnificent   croaked jacques three  the vengeance  also  highly approved    extermination is good doctrine  my wife   said defarge  rather troubled   in general  i say nothing against it  but this doctor has suffered much  you have seen him to day  you have observed his face when the paper was read     i have observed his face   repeated madame  contemptuously and angrily   yes  i have observed his face  i have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the republic  let him take care of his face     and you have observed  my wife   said defarge  in a deprecatory manner   the anguish of his daughter  which must be a dreadful anguish to him     i have observed his daughter   repeated madame   yes  i have observed his daughter  more times than one  i have observed her to day  and i have observed her other days  i have observed her in the court  and i have observed her in the street by the prison  let me but lift my finger     she seemed to raise it  the listener s eyes were always on his paper   and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her  as if the axe had dropped    the citizeness is superb   croaked the juryman    she is an angel   said the vengeance  and embraced her    as to thee   pursued madame  implacably  addressing her husband   if it depended on thee  which  happily  it does not  thou wouldst rescue this man even now     no   protested defarge   not if to lift this glass would do it  but i would leave the matter there  i say  stop there     see you then  jacques   said madame defarge  wrathfully   and see you  too  my little vengeance  see you both  listen  for other crimes as tyrants and oppressors  i have this race a long time on my register  doomed to destruction and extermination  ask my husband  is that so     it is so   assented defarge  without being asked    in the beginning of the great days  when the bastille falls  he finds this paper of to day  and he brings it home  and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut  we read it  here on this spot  by the light of this lamp  ask him  is that so     it is so   assented defarge    that night  i tell him  when the paper is read through  and the lamp is burnt out  and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars  that i have now a secret to communicate  ask him  is that so     it is so   assented defarge again    i communicate to him that secret  i smite this bosom with these two hands as i smite it now  and i tell him   defarge  i was brought up among the fishermen of the sea shore  and that peasant family so injured by the two evremonde brothers  as that bastille paper describes  is my family  defarge  that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister  that husband was my sister s husband  that unborn child was their child  that brother was my brother  that father was my father  those dead are my dead  and that summons to answer for those things descends to me   ask him  is that so     it is so   assented defarge once more    then tell wind and fire where to stop   returned madame   but don t tell me    both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath  the listener could feel how white she was  without seeing her  and both highly commended it  defarge  a weak minority  interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis  but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply   tell the wind and the fire where to stop  not me    customers entered  and the group was broken up  the english customer paid for what he had had  perplexedly counted his change  and asked  as a stranger  to be directed towards the national palace  madame defarge took him to the door  and put her arm on his  in pointing out the road  the english customer was not without his reflections then  that it might be a good deed to seize that arm  lift it  and strike under it sharp and deep   but  he went his way  and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall  at the appointed hour  he emerged from it to present himself in mr  lorry s room again  where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety  he said he had been with lucie until just now  and had only left her for a few minutes  to come and keep his appointment  her father had not been seen  since he quitted the banking house towards four o clock  she had some faint hopes that his mediation might save charles  but they were very slight  he had been more than five hours gone  where could he be   mr  lorry waited until ten  but  doctor manette not returning  and he being unwilling to leave lucie any longer  it was arranged that he should go back to her  and come to the banking house again at midnight  in the meanwhile  carton would wait alone by the fire for the doctor   he waited and waited  and the clock struck twelve  but doctor manette did not come back  mr  lorry returned  and found no tidings of him  and brought none  where could he be   they were discussing this question  and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence  when they heard him on the stairs  the instant he entered the room  it was plain that all was lost   whether he had really been to any one  or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets  was never known  as he stood staring at them  they asked him no question  for his face told them everything    i cannot find it   said he   and i must have it  where is it    his head and throat were bare  and  as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around  he took his coat off  and let it drop on the floor    where is my bench  i have been looking everywhere for my bench  and i can t find it  what have they done with my work  time presses  i must finish those shoes    they looked at one another  and their hearts died within them    come  come   said he  in a whimpering miserable way   let me get to work  give me my work    receiving no answer  he tore his hair  and beat his feet upon the ground  like a distracted child    don t torture a poor forlorn wretch   he implored them  with a dreadful cry   but give me my work  what is to become of us  if those shoes are not done to night    lost  utterly lost   it was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him  or try to restore him  that  as if by agreement  they each put a hand upon his shoulder  and soothed him to sit down before the fire  with a promise that he should have his work presently  he sank into the chair  and brooded over the embers  and shed tears  as if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy  or a dream  mr  lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that defarge had had in keeping   affected  and impressed with terror as they both were  by this spectacle of ruin  it was not a time to yield to such emotions  his lonely daughter  bereft of her final hope and reliance  appealed to them both too strongly  again  as if by agreement  they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces  carton was the first to speak    the last chance is gone  it was not much  yes  he had better be taken to her  but  before you go  will you  for a moment  steadily attend to me  don t ask me why i make the stipulations i am going to make  and exact the promise i am going to exact  i have a reason  a good one     i do not doubt it   answered mr  lorry   say on    the figure in the chair between them  was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro  and moaning  they spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick bed in the night   carton stooped to pick up the coat  which lay almost entangling his feet  as he did so  a small case in which the doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his day s duties  fell lightly on the floor  carton took it up  and there was a folded paper in it   we should look at this   he said  mr  lorry nodded his consent  he opened it  and exclaimed   thank god     what is it   asked mr  lorry  eagerly    a moment  let me speak of it in its place  first   he put his hand in his coat  and took another paper from it   that is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city  look at it  you see  sydney carton  an englishman    mr  lorry held it open in his hand  gazing in his earnest face    keep it for me until to morrow  i shall see him to morrow  you remember  and i had better not take it into the prison     why not     i don t know  i prefer not to do so  now  take this paper that doctor manette has carried about him  it is a similar certificate  enabling him and his daughter and her child  at any time  to pass the barrier and the frontier  you see     yes     perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil  yesterday  when is it dated  but no matter  don t stay to look  put it up carefully with mine and your own  now  observe  i never doubted until within this hour or two  that he had  or could have such a paper  it is good  until recalled  but it may be soon recalled  and  i have reason to think  will be     they are not in danger     they are in great danger  they are in danger of denunciation by madame defarge  i know it from her own lips  i have overheard words of that woman s  to night  which have presented their danger to me in strong colours  i have lost no time  and since then  i have seen the spy  he confirms me  he knows that a wood sawyer  living by the prison wall  is under the control of the defarges  and has been rehearsed by madame defarge as to his having seen her   he never mentioned lucie s name   making signs and signals to prisoners  it is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one  a prison plot  and that it will involve her life  and perhaps her child s  and perhaps her father s  for both have been seen with her at that place  don t look so horrified  you will save them all     heaven grant i may  carton  but how     i am going to tell you how  it will depend on you  and it could depend on no better man  this new denunciation will certainly not take place until after to morrow  probably not until two or three days afterwards  more probably a week afterwards  you know it is a capital crime  to mourn for  or sympathise with  a victim of the guillotine  she and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime  and this woman  the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described  would wait to add that strength to her case  and make herself doubly sure  you follow me     so attentively  and with so much confidence in what you say  that for the moment i lose sight   touching the back of the doctor s chair   even of this distress     you have money  and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made  your preparations have been completed for some days  to return to england  early to morrow have your horses ready  so that they may be in starting trim at two o clock in the afternoon     it shall be done    his manner was so fervent and inspiring  that mr  lorry caught the flame  and was as quick as youth    you are a noble heart  did i say we could depend upon no better man  tell her  to night  what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father  dwell upon that  for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband s cheerfully   he faltered for an instant  then went on as before   for the sake of her child and her father  press upon her the necessity of leaving paris  with them and you  at that hour  tell her that it was her husband s last arrangement  tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe  or hope  you think that her father  even in this sad state  will submit himself to her  do you not     i am sure of it     i thought so  quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here  even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage  the moment i come to you  take me in  and drive away     i understand that i wait for you under all circumstances     you have my certificate in your hand with the rest  you know  and will reserve my place  wait for nothing but to have my place occupied  and then for england     why  then   said mr  lorry  grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand   it does not all depend on one old man  but i shall have a young and ardent man at my side     by the help of heaven you shall  promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another     nothing  carton     remember these words to morrow  change the course  or delay in it  for any reason  and no life can possibly be saved  and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed     i will remember them  i hope to do my part faithfully     and i hope to do mine  now  good bye    though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness  and though he even put the old man s hand to his lips  he did not part from him then  he helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers  as to get a cloak and hat put upon it  and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have  he walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart  so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it  outwatched the awful night  he entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone  looking up at the light in the window of her room  before he went away  he breathed a blessing towards it  and a farewell      xiii  fifty two   in the black prison of the conciergerie  the doomed of the day awaited their fate  they were in number as the weeks of the year  fifty two were to roll that afternoon on the life tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea  before their cells were quit of them  new occupants were appointed  before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday  the blood that was to mingle with theirs to morrow was already set apart   two score and twelve were told off  from the farmer general of seventy  whose riches could not buy his life  to the seamstress of twenty  whose poverty and obscurity could not save her  physical diseases  engendered in the vices and neglects of men  will seize on victims of all degrees  and the frightful moral disorder  born of unspeakable suffering  intolerable oppression  and heartless indifference  smote equally without distinction   charles darnay  alone in a cell  had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal  in every line of the narrative he had heard  he had heard his condemnation  he had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him  that he was virtually sentenced by the millions  and that units could avail him nothing   nevertheless  it was not easy  with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him  to compose his mind to what it must bear  his hold on life was strong  and it was very  very hard  to loosen  by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here  it clenched the tighter there  and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded  this was closed again  there was a hurry  too  in all his thoughts  a turbulent and heated working of his heart  that contended against resignation  if  for a moment  he did feel resigned  then his wife and child who had to live after him  seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing   but  all this was at first  before long  the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet  and that numbers went the same road wrongfully  and trod it firmly every day  sprang up to stimulate him  next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones  depended on his quiet fortitude  so  by degrees he calmed into the better state  when he could raise his thoughts much higher  and draw comfort down   before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation  he had travelled thus far on his last way  being allowed to purchase the means of writing  and a light  he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished   he wrote a long letter to lucie  showing her that he had known nothing of her father s imprisonment  until he had heard of it from herself  and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father s and uncle s responsibility for that misery  until the paper had been read  he had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished  was the one condition  fully intelligible now  that her father had attached to their betrothal  and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage  he entreated her  for her father s sake  never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper  or had had it recalled to him  for the moment  or for good   by the story of the tower  on that old sunday under the dear old plane tree in the garden  if he had preserved any definite remembrance of it  there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the bastille  when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there  and which had been described to all the world  he besought her  though he added that he knew it was needless  to console her father  by impressing him through every tender means she could think of  with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself  but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes  next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing  and her overcoming of her sorrow  to devote herself to their dear child  he adjured her  as they would meet in heaven  to comfort her father   to her father himself  he wrote in the same strain  but  he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care  and he told him this  very strongly  with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending   to mr  lorry  he commended them all  and explained his worldly affairs  that done  with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment  all was done  he never thought of carton  his mind was so full of the others  that he never once thought of him   he had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out  when he lay down on his straw bed  he thought he had done with this world   but  it beckoned him back in his sleep  and showed itself in shining forms  free and happy  back in the old house in soho  though it had nothing in it like the real house   unaccountably released and light of heart  he was with lucie again  and she told him it was all a dream  and he had never gone away  a pause of forgetfulness  and then he had even suffered  and had come back to her  dead and at peace  and yet there was no difference in him  another pause of oblivion  and he awoke in the sombre morning  unconscious where he was or what had happened  until it flashed upon his mind   this is the day of my death    thus  had he come through the hours  to the day when the fifty two heads were to fall  and now  while he was composed  and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism  a new action began in his waking thoughts  which was very difficult to master   he had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life  how high it was from the ground  how many steps it had  where he would be stood  how he would be touched  whether the touching hands would be dyed red  which way his face would be turned  whether he would be the first  or might be the last  these and many similar questions  in nowise directed by his will  obtruded themselves over and over again  countless times  neither were they connected with fear  he was conscious of no fear  rather  they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came  a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred  a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his  than his own   the hours went on as he walked to and fro  and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again  nine gone for ever  ten gone for ever  eleven gone for ever  twelve coming on to pass away  after a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him  he had got the better of it  he walked up and down  softly repeating their names to himself  the worst of the strife was over  he could walk up and down  free from distracting fancies  praying for himself and for them   twelve gone for ever   he had been apprised that the final hour was three  and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier  inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets  therefore  he resolved to keep two before his mind  as the hour  and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able  after that time  to strengthen others   walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast  a very different man from the prisoner  who had walked to and fro at la force  he heard one struck away from him  without surprise  the hour had measured like most other hours  devoutly thankful to heaven for his recovered self possession  he thought   there is but another now   and turned to walk again   footsteps in the stone passage outside the door  he stopped   the key was put in the lock  and turned  before the door was opened  or as it opened  a man said in a low voice  in english   he has never seen me here  i have kept out of his way  go you in alone  i wait near  lose no time    the door was quickly opened and closed  and there stood before him face to face  quiet  intent upon him  with the light of a smile on his features  and a cautionary finger on his lip  sydney carton   there was something so bright and remarkable in his look  that  for the first moment  the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining  but  he spoke  and it was his voice  he took the prisoner s hand  and it was his real grasp    of all the people upon earth  you least expected to see me   he said    i could not believe it to be you  i can scarcely believe it now  you are not   the apprehension came suddenly into his mind   a prisoner     no  i am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here  and in virtue of it i stand before you  i come from her  your wife  dear darnay    the prisoner wrung his hand    i bring you a request from her     what is it     a most earnest  pressing  and emphatic entreaty  addressed to you in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you  that you well remember    the prisoner turned his face partly aside    you have no time to ask me why i bring it  or what it means  i have no time to tell you  you must comply with it  take off those boots you wear  and draw on these of mine    there was a chair against the wall of the cell  behind the prisoner  carton  pressing forward  had already  with the speed of lightning  got him down into it  and stood over him  barefoot    draw on these boots of mine  put your hands to them  put your will to them  quick     carton  there is no escaping from this place  it never can be done  you will only die with me  it is madness     it would be madness if i asked you to escape  but do i  when i ask you to pass out at that door  tell me it is madness and remain here  change that cravat for this of mine  that coat for this of mine  while you do it  let me take this ribbon from your hair  and shake out your hair like this of mine    with wonderful quickness  and with a strength both of will and action  that appeared quite supernatural  he forced all these changes upon him  the prisoner was like a young child in his hands    carton  dear carton  it is madness  it cannot be accomplished  it never can be done  it has been attempted  and has always failed  i implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine     do i ask you  my dear darnay  to pass the door  when i ask that  refuse  there are pen and ink and paper on this table  is your hand steady enough to write     it was when you came in     steady it again  and write what i shall dictate  quick  friend  quick    pressing his hand to his bewildered head  darnay sat down at the table  carton  with his right hand in his breast  stood close beside him    write exactly as i speak     to whom do i address it     to no one   carton still had his hand in his breast    do i date it     no    the prisoner looked up  at each question  carton  standing over him with his hand in his breast  looked down     if you remember    said carton  dictating    the words that passed between us  long ago  you will readily comprehend this when you see it  you do remember them  i know  it is not in your nature to forget them     he was drawing his hand from his breast  the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote  the hand stopped  closing upon something    have you written  forget them    carton asked    i have  is that a weapon in your hand     no  i am not armed     what is it in your hand     you shall know directly  write on  there are but a few words more   he dictated again    i am thankful that the time has come  when i can prove them  that i do so is no subject for regret or grief    as he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer  his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer s face   the pen dropped from darnay s fingers on the table  and he looked about him vacantly    what vapour is that   he asked    vapour     something that crossed me     i am conscious of nothing  there can be nothing here  take up the pen and finish  hurry  hurry    as if his memory were impaired  or his faculties disordered  the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention  as he looked at carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing  carton  his hand again in his breast  looked steadily at him    hurry  hurry    the prisoner bent over the paper  once more     if it had been otherwise    carton s hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down    i never should have used the longer opportunity  if it had been otherwise    the hand was at the prisoner s face    i should but have had so much the more to answer for  if it had been otherwise     carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs   carton s hand moved back to his breast no more  the prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look  but carton s hand was close and firm at his nostrils  and carton s left arm caught him round the waist  for a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him  but  within a minute or so  he was stretched insensible on the ground   quickly  but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was  carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside  combed back his hair  and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn  then  he softly called   enter there  come in   and the spy presented himself    you see   said carton  looking up  as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure  putting the paper in the breast   is your hazard very great     mr  carton   the spy answered  with a timid snap of his fingers   my hazard is not that  in the thick of business here  if you are true to the whole of your bargain     don t fear me  i will be true to the death     you must be  mr  carton  if the tale of fifty two is to be right  being made right by you in that dress  i shall have no fear     have no fear  i shall soon be out of the way of harming you  and the rest will soon be far from here  please god  now  get assistance and take me to the coach     you   said the spy nervously    him  man  with whom i have exchanged  you go out at the gate by which you brought me in     of course     i was weak and faint when you brought me in  and i am fainter now you take me out  the parting interview has overpowered me  such a thing has happened here  often  and too often  your life is in your own hands  quick  call assistance     you swear not to betray me   said the trembling spy  as he paused for a last moment    man  man   returned carton  stamping his foot   have i sworn by no solemn vow already  to go through with this  that you waste the precious moments now  take him yourself to the courtyard you know of  place him yourself in the carriage  show him yourself to mr  lorry  tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air  and to remember my words of last night  and his promise of last night  and drive away    the spy withdrew  and carton seated himself at the table  resting his forehead on his hands  the spy returned immediately  with two men    how  then   said one of them  contemplating the fallen figure   so afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of sainte guillotine     a good patriot   said the other   could hardly have been more afflicted if the aristocrat had drawn a blank    they raised the unconscious figure  placed it on a litter they had brought to the door  and bent to carry it away    the time is short  evremonde   said the spy  in a warning voice    i know it well   answered carton   be careful of my friend  i entreat you  and leave me     come  then  my children   said barsad   lift him  and come away    the door closed  and carton was left alone  straining his powers of listening to the utmost  he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm  there was none  keys turned  doors clashed  footsteps passed along distant passages  no cry was raised  or hurry made  that seemed unusual  breathing more freely in a little while  he sat down at the table  and listened again until the clock struck two   sounds that he was not afraid of  for he divined their meaning  then began to be audible  several doors were opened in succession  and finally his own  a gaoler  with a list in his hand  looked in  merely saying   follow me  evremonde   and he followed into a large dark room  at a distance  it was a dark winter day  and what with the shadows within  and what with the shadows without  he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound  some were standing  some seated  some were lamenting  and in restless motion  but  these were few  the great majority were silent and still  looking fixedly at the ground   as he stood by the wall in a dim corner  while some of the fifty two were brought in after him  one man stopped in passing  to embrace him  as having a knowledge of him  it thrilled him with a great dread of discovery  but the man went on  a very few moments after that  a young woman  with a slight girlish form  a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour  and large widely opened patient eyes  rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting  and came to speak to him    citizen evremonde   she said  touching him with her cold hand   i am a poor little seamstress  who was with you in la force    he murmured for answer   true  i forget what you were accused of     plots  though the just heaven knows that i am innocent of any  is it likely  who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me    the forlorn smile with which she said it  so touched him  that tears started from his eyes    i am not afraid to die  citizen evremonde  but i have done nothing  i am not unwilling to die  if the republic which is to do so much good to us poor  will profit by my death  but i do not know how that can be  citizen evremonde  such a poor weak little creature    as the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to  it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl    i heard you were released  citizen evremonde  i hoped it was true     it was  but  i was again taken and condemned     if i may ride with you  citizen evremonde  will you let me hold your hand  i am not afraid  but i am little and weak  and it will give me more courage    as the patient eyes were lifted to his face  he saw a sudden doubt in them  and then astonishment  he pressed the work worn  hunger worn young fingers  and touched his lips    are you dying for him   she whispered    and his wife and child  hush  yes     o you will let me hold your brave hand  stranger     hush  yes  my poor sister  to the last                   the same shadows that are falling on the prison  are falling  in that same hour of the early afternoon  on the barrier with the crowd about it  when a coach going out of paris drives up to be examined    who goes here  whom have we within  papers    the papers are handed out  and read    alexandre manette  physician  french  which is he    this is he  this helpless  inarticulately murmuring  wandering old man pointed out    apparently the citizen doctor is not in his right mind  the revolution fever will have been too much for him    greatly too much for him    hah  many suffer with it  lucie  his daughter  french  which is she    this is she    apparently it must be  lucie  the wife of evremonde  is it not    it is    hah  evremonde has an assignation elsewhere  lucie  her child  english  this is she    she and no other    kiss me  child of evremonde  now  thou hast kissed a good republican  something new in thy family  remember it  sydney carton  advocate  english  which is he    he lies here  in this corner of the carriage  he  too  is pointed out    apparently the english advocate is in a swoon    it is hoped he will recover in the fresher air  it is represented that he is not in strong health  and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the republic    is that all  it is not a great deal  that  many are under the displeasure of the republic  and must look out at the little window  jarvis lorry  banker  english  which is he     i am he  necessarily  being the last    it is jarvis lorry who has replied to all the previous questions  it is jarvis lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door  replying to a group of officials  they leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box  to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof  the country people hanging about  press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in  a little child  carried by its mother  has its short arm held out for it  that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the guillotine    behold your papers  jarvis lorry  countersigned     one can depart  citizen     one can depart  forward  my postilions  a good journey     i salute you  citizens   and the first danger passed    these are again the words of jarvis lorry  as he clasps his hands  and looks upward  there is terror in the carriage  there is weeping  there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller    are we not going too slowly  can they not be induced to go faster    asks lucie  clinging to the old man    it would seem like flight  my darling  i must not urge them too much  it would rouse suspicion     look back  look back  and see if we are pursued     the road is clear  my dearest  so far  we are not pursued    houses in twos and threes pass by us  solitary farms  ruinous buildings  dye works  tanneries  and the like  open country  avenues of leafless trees  the hard uneven pavement is under us  the soft deep mud is on either side  sometimes  we strike into the skirting mud  to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us  sometimes  we stick in ruts and sloughs there  the agony of our impatience is then so great  that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running  hiding  doing anything but stopping   out of the open country  in again among ruinous buildings  solitary farms  dye works  tanneries  and the like  cottages in twos and threes  avenues of leafless trees  have these men deceived us  and taken us back by another road  is not this the same place twice over  thank heaven  no  a village  look back  look back  and see if we are pursued  hush  the posting house   leisurely  our four horses are taken out  leisurely  the coach stands in the little street  bereft of horses  and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again  leisurely  the new horses come into visible existence  one by one  leisurely  the new postilions follow  sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips  leisurely  the old postilions count their money  make wrong additions  and arrive at dissatisfied results  all the time  our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled   at length the new postilions are in their saddles  and the old are left behind  we are through the village  up the hill  and down the hill  and on the low watery grounds  suddenly  the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation  and the horses are pulled up  almost on their haunches  we are pursued    ho  within the carriage there  speak then     what is it   asks mr  lorry  looking out at window    how many did they say     i do not understand you       at the last post  how many to the guillotine to day     fifty two     i said so  a brave number  my fellow citizen here would have it forty two  ten more heads are worth having  the guillotine goes handsomely  i love it  hi forward  whoop    the night comes on dark  he moves more  he is beginning to revive  and to speak intelligibly  he thinks they are still together  he asks him  by his name  what he has in his hand  o pity us  kind heaven  and help us  look out  look out  and see if we are pursued   the wind is rushing after us  and the clouds are flying after us  and the moon is plunging after us  and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us  but  so far  we are pursued by nothing else      xiv  the knitting done   in that same juncture of time when the fifty two awaited their fate madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and jacques three of the revolutionary jury  not in the wine shop did madame defarge confer with these ministers  but in the shed of the wood sawyer  erst a mender of roads  the sawyer himself did not participate in the conference  but abided at a little distance  like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required  or to offer an opinion until invited    but our defarge   said jacques three   is undoubtedly a good republican  eh     there is no better   the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill notes   in france     peace  little vengeance   said madame defarge  laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant s lips   hear me speak  my husband  fellow citizen  is a good republican and a bold man  he has deserved well of the republic  and possesses its confidence  but my husband has his weaknesses  and he is so weak as to relent towards this doctor     it is a great pity   croaked jacques three  dubiously shaking his head  with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth   it is not quite like a good citizen  it is a thing to regret     see you   said madame   i care nothing for this doctor  i  he may wear his head or lose it  for any interest i have in him  it is all one to me  but  the evremonde people are to be exterminated  and the wife and child must follow the husband and father     she has a fine head for it   croaked jacques three   i have seen blue eyes and golden hair there  and they looked charming when samson held them up   ogre that he was  he spoke like an epicure   madame defarge cast down her eyes  and reflected a little    the child also   observed jacques three  with a meditative enjoyment of his words   has golden hair and blue eyes  and we seldom have a child there  it is a pretty sight     in a word   said madame defarge  coming out of her short abstraction   i cannot trust my husband in this matter  not only do i feel  since last night  that i dare not confide to him the details of my projects  but also i feel that if i delay  there is danger of his giving warning  and then they might escape     that must never be   croaked jacques three   no one must escape  we have not half enough as it is  we ought to have six score a day     in a word   madame defarge went on   my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation  and i have not his reason for regarding this doctor with any sensibility  i must act for myself  therefore  come hither  little citizen    the wood sawyer  who held her in the respect  and himself in the submission  of mortal fear  advanced with his hand to his red cap    touching those signals  little citizen   said madame defarge  sternly   that she made to the prisoners  you are ready to bear witness to them this very day     ay  ay  why not   cried the sawyer   every day  in all weathers  from two to four  always signalling  sometimes with the little one  sometimes without  i know what i know  i have seen with my eyes    he made all manner of gestures while he spoke  as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen    clearly plots   said jacques three   transparently     there is no doubt of the jury   inquired madame defarge  letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile    rely upon the patriotic jury  dear citizeness  i answer for my fellow jurymen     now  let me see   said madame defarge  pondering again   yet once more  can i spare this doctor to my husband  i have no feeling either way  can i spare him     he would count as one head   observed jacques three  in a low voice   we really have not heads enough  it would be a pity  i think     he was signalling with her when i saw her   argued madame defarge   i cannot speak of one without the other  and i must not be silent  and trust the case wholly to him  this little citizen here  for  i am not a bad witness    the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses  the little citizen  not to be outdone  declared her to be a celestial witness    he must take his chance   said madame defarge   no  i cannot spare him  you are engaged at three o clock  you are going to see the batch of to day executed   you    the question was addressed to the wood sawyer  who hurriedly replied in the affirmative  seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of republicans  and that he would be in effect the most desolate of republicans  if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber  he was so very demonstrative herein  that he might have been suspected  perhaps was  by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of madame defarge s head  of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety  every hour in the day    i   said madame   am equally engaged at the same place  after it is over  say at eight to night  come you to me  in saint antoine  and we will give information against these people at my section    the wood sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness  the citizeness looking at him  he became embarrassed  evaded her glance as a small dog would have done  retreated among his wood  and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw   madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a little nearer to the door  and there expounded her further views to them thus    she will now be at home  awaiting the moment of his death  she will be mourning and grieving  she will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the republic  she will be full of sympathy with its enemies  i will go to her     what an admirable woman  what an adorable woman   exclaimed jacques three  rapturously   ah  my cherished   cried the vengeance  and embraced her    take you my knitting   said madame defarge  placing it in her lieutenant s hands   and have it ready for me in my usual seat  keep me my usual chair  go you there  straight  for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual  to day     i willingly obey the orders of my chief   said the vengeance with alacrity  and kissing her cheek   you will not be late     i shall be there before the commencement     and before the tumbrils arrive  be sure you are there  my soul   said the vengeance  calling after her  for she had already turned into the street   before the tumbrils arrive    madame defarge slightly waved her hand  to imply that she heard  and might be relied upon to arrive in good time  and so went through the mud  and round the corner of the prison wall  the vengeance and the juryman  looking after her as she walked away  were highly appreciative of her fine figure  and her superb moral endowments   there were many women at that time  upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand  but  there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman  now taking her way along the streets  of a strong and fearless character  of shrewd sense and readiness  of great determination  of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity  but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities  the troubled time would have heaved her up  under any circumstances  but  imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong  and an inveterate hatred of a class  opportunity had developed her into a tigress  she was absolutely without pity  if she had ever had the virtue in her  it had quite gone out of her   it was nothing to her  that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers  she saw  not him  but them  it was nothing to her  that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan  that was insufficient punishment  because they were her natural enemies and her prey  and as such had no right to live  to appeal to her  was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity  even for herself  if she had been laid low in the streets  in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged  she would not have pitied herself  nor  if she had been ordered to the axe to morrow  would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there   such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe  carelessly worn  it was a becoming robe enough  in a certain weird way  and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap  lying hidden in her bosom  was a loaded pistol  lying hidden at her waist  was a sharpened dagger  thus accoutred  and walking with the confident tread of such a character  and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood  bare foot and bare legged  on the brown sea sand  madame defarge took her way along the streets   now  when the journey of the travelling coach  at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load  had been planned out last night  the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engaged mr  lorry s attention  it was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach  but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers  should be reduced to the utmost  since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there  finally  he had proposed  after anxious consideration  that miss pross and jerry  who were at liberty to leave the city  should leave it at three o clock in the lightest wheeled conveyance known to that period  unencumbered with luggage  they would soon overtake the coach  and  passing it and preceding it on the road  would order its horses in advance  and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night  when delay was the most to be dreaded   seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency  miss pross hailed it with joy  she and jerry had beheld the coach start  had known who it was that solomon brought  had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense  and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach  even as madame defarge  taking her way through the streets  now drew nearer and nearer to the else deserted lodging in which they held their consultation    now what do you think  mr  cruncher   said miss pross  whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak  or stand  or move  or live   what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard  another carriage having already gone from here to day  it might awaken suspicion     my opinion  miss   returned mr  cruncher   is as you re right  likewise wot i ll stand by you  right or wrong     i am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures   said miss pross  wildly crying   that i am incapable of forming any plan  are you capable of forming any plan  my dear good mr  cruncher     respectin  a future spear o  life  miss   returned mr  cruncher   i hope so  respectin  any present use o  this here blessed old head o  mine  i think not  would you do me the favour  miss  to take notice o  two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis     oh  for gracious sake   cried miss pross  still wildly crying   record them at once  and get them out of the way  like an excellent man     first   said mr  cruncher  who was all in a tremble  and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage   them poor things well out o  this  never no more will i do it  never no more     i am quite sure  mr  cruncher   returned miss pross   that you never will do it again  whatever it is  and i beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is     no  miss   returned jerry   it shall not be named to you  second  them poor things well out o  this  and never no more will i interfere with mrs  cruncher s flopping  never no more     whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be   said miss pross  striving to dry her eyes and compose herself   i have no doubt it is best that mrs  cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence   o my poor darlings     i go so far as to say  miss  moreover   proceeded mr  cruncher  with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit   and let my words be took down and took to mrs  cruncher through yourself  that wot my opinions respectin  flopping has undergone a change  and that wot i only hope with all my heart as mrs  cruncher may be a flopping at the present time     there  there  there  i hope she is  my dear man   cried the distracted miss pross   and i hope she finds it answering her expectations     forbid it   proceeded mr  cruncher  with additional solemnity  additional slowness  and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out   as anything wot i have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now  forbid it as we shouldn t all flop  if it was anyways conwenient  to get  em out o  this here dismal risk  forbid it  miss  wot i say  for bid it   this was mr  cruncher s conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one   and still madame defarge  pursuing her way along the streets  came nearer and nearer    if we ever get back to our native land   said miss pross   you may rely upon my telling mrs  cruncher as much as i may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said  and at all events you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time  now  pray let us think  my esteemed mr  cruncher  let us think    still  madame defarge  pursuing her way along the streets  came nearer and nearer    if you were to go before   said miss pross   and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here  and were to wait somewhere for me  wouldn t that be best    mr  cruncher thought it might be best    where could you wait for me   asked miss pross   mr  cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but temple bar  alas  temple bar was hundreds of miles away  and madame defarge was drawing very near indeed    by the cathedral door   said miss pross   would it be much out of the way  to take me in  near the great cathedral door between the two towers     no  miss   answered mr  cruncher    then  like the best of men   said miss pross   go to the posting house straight  and make that change     i am doubtful   said mr  cruncher  hesitating and shaking his head   about leaving of you  you see  we don t know what may happen     heaven knows we don t   returned miss pross   but have no fear for me  take me in at the cathedral  at three o clock  or as near it as you can  and i am sure it will be better than our going from here  i feel certain of it  there  bless you  mr  cruncher  think not of me  but of the lives that may depend on both of us    this exordium  and miss pross s two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his  decided mr  cruncher  with an encouraging nod or two  he immediately went out to alter the arrangements  and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed   the having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution  was a great relief to miss pross  the necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets  was another relief  she looked at her watch  and it was twenty minutes past two  she had no time to lose  but must get ready at once   afraid  in her extreme perturbation  of the loneliness of the deserted rooms  and of half imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them  miss pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes  which were swollen and red  haunted by her feverish apprehensions  she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water  but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her  in one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out  for she saw a figure standing in the room   the basin fell to the ground broken  and the water flowed to the feet of madame defarge  by strange stern ways  and through much staining blood  those feet had come to meet that water   madame defarge looked coldly at her  and said   the wife of evremonde  where is she    it flashed upon miss pross s mind that the doors were all standing open  and would suggest the flight  her first act was to shut them  there were four in the room  and she shut them all  she then placed herself before the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied   madame defarge s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement  and rested on her when it was finished  miss pross had nothing beautiful about her  years had not tamed the wildness  or softened the grimness  of her appearance  but  she too was a determined woman in her different way  and she measured madame defarge with her eyes  every inch    you might  from your appearance  be the wife of lucifer   said miss pross  in her breathing   nevertheless  you shall not get the better of me  i am an englishwoman    madame defarge looked at her scornfully  but still with something of miss pross s own perception that they two were at bay  she saw a tight  hard  wiry woman before her  as mr  lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand  in the years gone by  she knew full well that miss pross was the family s devoted friend  miss pross knew full well that madame defarge was the family s malevolent enemy    on my way yonder   said madame defarge  with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot   where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me  i am come to make my compliments to her in passing  i wish to see her     i know that your intentions are evil   said miss pross   and you may depend upon it  i ll hold my own against them    each spoke in her own language  neither understood the other s words  both were very watchful  and intent to deduce from look and manner  what the unintelligible words meant    it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment   said madame defarge   good patriots will know what that means  let me see her  go tell her that i wish to see her  do you hear     if those eyes of yours were bed winches   returned miss pross   and i was an english four poster  they shouldn t loose a splinter of me  no  you wicked foreign woman  i am your match    madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail  but  she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught    woman imbecile and pig like   said madame defarge  frowning   i take no answer from you  i demand to see her  either tell her that i demand to see her  or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her    this  with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm    i little thought   said miss pross   that i should ever want to understand your nonsensical language  but i would give all i have  except the clothes i wear  to know whether you suspect the truth  or any part of it    neither of them for a single moment released the other s eyes  madame defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross first became aware of her  but  she now advanced one step    i am a briton   said miss pross   i am desperate  i don t care an english twopence for myself  i know that the longer i keep you here  the greater hope there is for my ladybird  i ll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head  if you lay a finger on me    thus miss pross  with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence  and every rapid sentence a whole breath  thus miss pross  who had never struck a blow in her life   but  her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes  this was a courage that madame defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness   ha  ha   she laughed   you poor wretch  what are you worth  i address myself to that doctor   then she raised her voice and called out   citizen doctor  wife of evremonde  child of evremonde  any person but this miserable fool  answer the citizeness defarge    perhaps the following silence  perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of miss pross s face  perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion  whispered to madame defarge that they were gone  three of the doors she opened swiftly  and looked in    those rooms are all in disorder  there has been hurried packing  there are odds and ends upon the ground  there is no one in that room behind you  let me look     never   said miss pross  who understood the request as perfectly as madame defarge understood the answer    if they are not in that room  they are gone  and can be pursued and brought back   said madame defarge to herself    as long as you don t know whether they are in that room or not  you are uncertain what to do   said miss pross to herself   and you shall not know that  if i can prevent your knowing it  and know that  or not know that  you shall not leave here while i can hold you     i have been in the streets from the first  nothing has stopped me  i will tear you to pieces  but i will have you from that door   said madame defarge    we are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard  we are not likely to be heard  and i pray for bodily strength to keep you here  while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling   said miss pross   madame defarge made at the door  miss pross  on the instinct of the moment  seized her round the waist in both her arms  and held her tight  it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike  miss pross  with the vigorous tenacity of love  always so much stronger than hate  clasped her tight  and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had  the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and tore her face  but  miss pross  with her head down  held her round the waist  and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman   soon  madame defarge s hands ceased to strike  and felt at her encircled waist   it is under my arm   said miss pross  in smothered tones   you shall not draw it  i am stronger than you  i bless heaven for it  i hold you till one or other of us faints or dies    madame defarge s hands were at her bosom  miss pross looked up  saw what it was  struck at it  struck out a flash and a crash  and stood alone  blinded with smoke   all this was in a second  as the smoke cleared  leaving an awful stillness  it passed out on the air  like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground   in the first fright and horror of her situation  miss pross passed the body as far from it as she could  and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help  happily  she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did  in time to check herself and go back  it was dreadful to go in at the door again  but  she did go in  and even went near it  to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear  these she put on  out on the staircase  first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key  she then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry  and then got up and hurried away   by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet  or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped  by good fortune  too  she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman  she needed both advantages  for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face  and her hair was torn  and her dress  hastily composed with unsteady hands  was clutched and dragged a hundred ways   in crossing the bridge  she dropped the door key in the river  arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort  and waiting there  she thought  what if the key were already taken in a net  what if it were identified  what if the door were opened and the remains discovered  what if she were stopped at the gate  sent to prison  and charged with murder  in the midst of these fluttering thoughts  the escort appeared  took her in  and took her away    is there any noise in the streets   she asked him    the usual noises   mr  cruncher replied  and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect    i don t hear you   said miss pross   what do you say    it was in vain for mr  cruncher to repeat what he said  miss pross could not hear him   so i ll nod my head   thought mr  cruncher  amazed   at all events she ll see that   and she did    is there any noise in the streets now   asked miss pross again  presently   again mr  cruncher nodded his head    i don t hear it     gone deaf in an hour   said mr  cruncher  ruminating  with his mind much disturbed   wot s come to her     i feel   said miss pross   as if there had been a flash and a crash  and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life     blest if she ain t in a queer condition   said mr  cruncher  more and more disturbed   wot can she have been a takin   to keep her courage up  hark  there s the roll of them dreadful carts  you can hear that  miss     i can hear   said miss pross  seeing that he spoke to her   nothing  o  my good man  there was first a great crash  and then a great stillness  and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable  never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts     if she don t hear the roll of those dreadful carts  now very nigh their journey s end   said mr  cruncher  glancing over his shoulder   it s my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world    and indeed she never did      xv  the footsteps die out for ever   along the paris streets  the death carts rumble  hollow and harsh  six tumbrils carry the day s wine to la guillotine  all the devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could record itself  are fused in the one realisation  guillotine  and yet there is not in france  with its rich variety of soil and climate  a blade  a leaf  a root  a sprig  a peppercorn  which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror  crush humanity out of shape once more  under similar hammers  and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms  sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again  and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind   six tumbrils roll along the streets  change these back again to what they were  thou powerful enchanter  time  and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs  the equipages of feudal nobles  the toilettes of flaring jezebels  the churches that are not my father s house but dens of thieves  the huts of millions of starving peasants  no  the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the creator  never reverses his transformations   if thou be changed into this shape by the will of god   say the seers to the enchanted  in the wise arabian stories   then remain so  but  if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration  then resume thy former aspect    changeless and hopeless  the tumbrils roll along   as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round  they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets  ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that  and the ploughs go steadily onward  so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle  that in many windows there are no people  and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended  while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils  here and there  the inmate has visitors to see the sight  then he points his finger  with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent  to this cart and to this  and seems to tell who sat here yesterday  and who there the day before   of the riders in the tumbrils  some observe these things  and all things on their last roadside  with an impassive stare  others  with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men  some  seated with drooping heads  are sunk in silent despair  again  there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres  and in pictures  several close their eyes  and think  or try to get their straying thoughts together  only one  and he a miserable creature  of a crazed aspect  is so shattered and made drunk by horror  that he sings  and tries to dance  not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture  to the pity of the people   there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils  and faces are often turned up to some of them  and they are asked some question  it would seem to be always the same question  for  it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart  the horsemen abreast of that cart  frequently point out one man in it with their swords  the leading curiosity is  to know which is he  he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down  to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart  and holds his hand  he has no curiosity or care for the scene about him  and always speaks to the girl  here and there in the long street of st  honore  cries are raised against him  if they move him at all  it is only to a quiet smile  as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face  he cannot easily touch his face  his arms being bound   on the steps of a church  awaiting the coming up of the tumbrils  stands the spy and prison sheep  he looks into the first of them  not there  he looks into the second  not there  he already asks himself   has he sacrificed me   when his face clears  as he looks into the third    which is evremonde   says a man behind him    that  at the back there     with his hand in the girl s     yes    the man cries   down  evremonde  to the guillotine all aristocrats  down  evremonde     hush  hush   the spy entreats him  timidly    and why not  citizen     he is going to pay the forfeit  it will be paid in five minutes more  let him be at peace    but the man continuing to exclaim   down  evremonde   the face of evremonde is for a moment turned towards him  evremonde then sees the spy  and looks attentively at him  and goes his way   the clocks are on the stroke of three  and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round  to come on into the place of execution  and end  the ridges thrown to this side and to that  now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on  for all are following to the guillotine  in front of it  seated in chairs  as in a garden of public diversion  are a number of women  busily knitting  on one of the fore most chairs  stands the vengeance  looking about for her friend    therese   she cries  in her shrill tones   who has seen her  therese defarge     she never missed before   says a knitting woman of the sisterhood    no  nor will she miss now   cries the vengeance  petulantly   therese     louder   the woman recommends   ay  louder  vengeance  much louder  and still she will scarcely hear thee  louder yet  vengeance  with a little oath or so added  and yet it will hardly bring her  send other women up and down to seek her  lingering somewhere  and yet  although the messengers have done dread deeds  it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her    bad fortune   cries the vengeance  stamping her foot in the chair   and here are the tumbrils  and evremonde will be despatched in a wink  and she not here  see her knitting in my hand  and her empty chair ready for her  i cry with vexation and disappointment    as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it  the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads  the ministers of sainte guillotine are robed and ready  crash   a head is held up  and the knitting women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak  count one   the second tumbril empties and moves on  the third comes up  crash   and the knitting women  never faltering or pausing in their work  count two   the supposed evremonde descends  and the seamstress is lifted out next after him  he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out  but still holds it as he promised  he gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls  and she looks into his face and thanks him    but for you  dear stranger  i should not be so composed  for i am naturally a poor little thing  faint of heart  nor should i have been able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death  that we might have hope and comfort here to day  i think you were sent to me by heaven     or you to me   says sydney carton   keep your eyes upon me  dear child  and mind no other object     i mind nothing while i hold your hand  i shall mind nothing when i let it go  if they are rapid     they will be rapid  fear not    the two stand in the fast thinning throng of victims  but they speak as if they were alone  eye to eye  voice to voice  hand to hand  heart to heart  these two children of the universal mother  else so wide apart and differing  have come together on the dark highway  to repair home together  and to rest in her bosom    brave and generous friend  will you let me ask you one last question  i am very ignorant  and it troubles me  just a little     tell me what it is     i have a cousin  an only relative and an orphan  like myself  whom i love very dearly  she is five years younger than i  and she lives in a farmer s house in the south country  poverty parted us  and she knows nothing of my fate  for i cannot write  and if i could  how should i tell her  it is better as it is     yes  yes  better as it is     what i have been thinking as we came along  and what i am still thinking now  as i look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support  is this   if the republic really does good to the poor  and they come to be less hungry  and in all ways to suffer less  she may live a long time  she may even live to be old     what then  my gentle sister     do you think   the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance  fill with tears  and the lips part a little more and tremble   that it will seem long to me  while i wait for her in the better land where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered     it cannot be  my child  there is no time there  and no trouble there     you comfort me so much  i am so ignorant  am i to kiss you now  is the moment come     yes    she kisses his lips  he kisses hers  they solemnly bless each other  the spare hand does not tremble as he releases it  nothing worse than a sweet  bright constancy is in the patient face  she goes next before him  is gone  the knitting women count twenty two    i am the resurrection and the life  saith the lord  he that believeth in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live  and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die    the murmuring of many voices  the upturning of many faces  the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd  so that it swells forward in a mass  like one great heave of water  all flashes away  twenty three                  they said of him  about the city that night  that it was the peacefullest man s face ever beheld there  many added that he looked sublime and prophetic   one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe  a woman  had asked at the foot of the same scaffold  not long before  to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her  if he had given any utterance to his  and they were prophetic  they would have been these    i see barsad  and cly  defarge  the vengeance  the juryman  the judge  long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old  perishing by this retributive instrument  before it shall cease out of its present use  i see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss  and  in their struggles to be truly free  in their triumphs and defeats  through long years to come  i see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth  gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out    i see the lives for which i lay down my life  peaceful  useful  prosperous and happy  in that england which i shall see no more  i see her with a child upon her bosom  who bears my name  i see her father  aged and bent  but otherwise restored  and faithful to all men in his healing office  and at peace  i see the good old man  so long their friend  in ten years  time enriching them with all he has  and passing tranquilly to his reward    i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts  and in the hearts of their descendants  generations hence  i see her  an old woman  weeping for me on the anniversary of this day  i see her and her husband  their course done  lying side by side in their last earthly bed  and i know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other s soul  than i was in the souls of both    i see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name  a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine  i see him winning it so well  that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his  i see the blots i threw upon it  faded away  i see him  fore most of just judges and honoured men  bringing a boy of my name  with a forehead that i know and golden hair  to this place  then fair to look upon  with not a trace of this day s disfigurement  and i hear him tell the child my story  with a tender and a faltering voice    it is a

wisdom  it was the age of foolishness  it was the epoch of belief  it was the epoch of incredulity  it was the season of light  it was the season of darkness  it was the spring of hope  it was the winter of despair  we had everything before us  we had nothing before us  we were all going direct to heaven  we were all going direct the other way  in short  the period was so far like the present period  that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received  for good or for evil  in the superlative degree of comparison only   there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face  on the throne of england  there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face  on the throne of france  in both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the state preserves of loaves and fishes  that things in general were settled for ever   it was the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy five  spiritual revelations were conceded to england at that favoured period  as at this  mrs  southcott had recently attained her five and twentieth blessed birthday  of whom a prophetic private in the life guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of london and westminster  even the cock lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years  after rapping out its messages  as the spirits of this very year last past  supernaturally deficient in originality  rapped out theirs  mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the english crown and people  from a congress of british subjects in america  which  strange to relate  have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the cock lane brood   france  less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident  rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill  making paper money and spending it  under the guidance of her christian pastors  she entertained herself  besides  with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off  his tongue torn out with pincers  and his body burned alive  because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view  at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards  it is likely enough that  rooted in the woods of france and norway  there were growing trees  when that sufferer was put to death  already marked by the woodman  fate  to come down and be sawn into boards  to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it  terrible in history  it is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to paris  there were sheltered from the weather that very day  rude carts  bespattered with rustic mire  snuffed about by pigs  and roosted in by poultry  which the farmer  death  had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the revolution  but that woodman and that farmer  though they work unceasingly  work silently  and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread  the rather  forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake  was to be atheistical and traitorous   in england  there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting  daring burglaries by armed men  and highway robberies  took place in the capital itself every night  families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers  warehouses for security  the highwayman in the dark was a city tradesman in the light  and  being recognised and challenged by his fellow tradesman whom he stopped in his character of  the captain   gallantly shot him through the head and rode away  the mail was waylaid by seven robbers  and the guard shot three dead  and then got shot dead himself by the other four   in consequence of the failure of his ammunition   after which the mail was robbed in peace  that magnificent potentate  the lord mayor of london  was made to stand and deliver on turnham green  by one highwayman  who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue  prisoners in london gaols fought battles with their turnkeys  and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them  loaded with rounds of shot and ball  thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at court drawing rooms  musketeers went into st  giles s  to search for contraband goods  and the mob fired on the musketeers  and the musketeers fired on the mob  and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way  in the midst of them  the hangman  ever busy and ever worse than useless  was in constant requisition  now  stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals  now  hanging a housebreaker on saturday who had been taken on tuesday  now  burning people in the hand at newgate by the dozen  and now burning pamphlets at the door of westminster hall  to day  taking the life of an atrocious murderer  and to morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer s boy of sixpence   all these things  and a thousand like them  came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy five  environed by them  while the woodman and the farmer worked unheeded  those two of the large jaws  and those other two of the plain and the fair faces  trod with stir enough  and carried their divine rights with a high hand  thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy five conduct their greatnesses  and myriads of small creatures  the creatures of this chronicle among the rest  along the roads that lay before them      ii  the mail   it was the dover road that lay  on a friday night late in november  before the first of the persons with whom this history has business  the dover road lay  as to him  beyond the dover mail  as it lumbered up shooter s hill  he walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail  as the rest of the passengers did  not because they had the least relish for walking exercise  under the circumstances  but because the hill  and the harness  and the mud  and the mail  were all so heavy  that the horses had three times already come to a stop  besides once drawing the coach across the road  with the mutinous intent of taking it back to blackheath  reins and whip and coachman and guard  however  in combination  had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument  that some brute animals are endued with reason  and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty   with drooping heads and tremulous tails  they mashed their way through the thick mud  floundering and stumbling between whiles  as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints  as often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand  with a wary  wo ho  so ho then   the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it  like an unusually emphatic horse  denying that the coach could be got up the hill  whenever the leader made this rattle  the passenger started  as a nervous passenger might  and was disturbed in mind   there was a steaming mist in all the hollows  and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill  like an evil spirit  seeking rest and finding none  a clammy and intensely cold mist  it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another  as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do  it was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach lamps but these its own workings  and a few yards of road  and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it  as if they had made it all   two other passengers  besides the one  were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail  all three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears  and wore jack boots  not one of the three could have said  from anything he saw  what either of the other two was like  and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind  as from the eyes of the body  of his two companions  in those days  travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice  for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers  as to the latter  when every posting house and ale house could produce somebody in  the captain s  pay  ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non descript  it was the likeliest thing upon the cards  so the guard of the dover mail thought to himself  that friday night in november  one thousand seven hundred and seventy five  lumbering up shooter s hill  as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail  beating his feet  and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm chest before him  where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse pistols  deposited on a substratum of cutlass   the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers  the passengers suspected one another and the guard  they all suspected everybody else  and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses  as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two testaments that they were not fit for the journey    wo ho   said the coachman   so  then  one more pull and you re at the top and be damned to you  for i have had trouble enough to get you to it   joe     halloa   the guard replied    what o clock do you make it  joe     ten minutes  good  past eleven     my blood   ejaculated the vexed coachman   and not atop of shooter s yet  tst  yah  get on with you    the emphatic horse  cut short by the whip in a most decided negative  made a decided scramble for it  and the three other horses followed suit  once more  the dover mail struggled on  with the jack boots of its passengers squashing along by its side  they had stopped when the coach stopped  and they kept close company with it  if any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness  he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman   the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill  the horses stopped to breathe again  and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent  and open the coach door to let the passengers in    tst  joe   cried the coachman in a warning voice  looking down from his box    what do you say  tom    they both listened    i say a horse at a canter coming up  joe     i say a horse at a gallop  tom   returned the guard  leaving his hold of the door  and mounting nimbly to his place   gentlemen  in the king s name  all of you    with this hurried adjuration  he cocked his blunderbuss  and stood on the offensive   the passenger booked by this history  was on the coach step  getting in  the two other passengers were close behind him  and about to follow  he remained on the step  half in the coach and half out of  they remained in the road below him  they all looked from the coachman to the guard  and from the guard to the coachman  and listened  the coachman looked back and the guard looked back  and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back  without contradicting   the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach  added to the stillness of the night  made it very quiet indeed  the panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach  as if it were in a state of agitation  the hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard  but at any rate  the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath  and holding the breath  and having the pulses quickened by expectation   the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill    so ho   the guard sang out  as loud as he could roar   yo there  stand  i shall fire    the pace was suddenly checked  and  with much splashing and floundering  a man s voice called from the mist   is that the dover mail     never you mind what it is   the guard retorted   what are you     is that the dover mail     why do you want to know     i want a passenger  if it is     what passenger     mr  jarvis lorry    our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name  the guard  the coachman  and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully    keep where you are   the guard called to the voice in the mist   because  if i should make a mistake  it could never be set right in your lifetime  gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight     what is the matter   asked the passenger  then  with mildly quavering speech   who wants me  is it jerry      i don t like jerry s voice  if it is jerry   growled the guard to himself   he s hoarser than suits me  is jerry      yes  mr  lorry     what is the matter     a despatch sent after you from over yonder  t  and co     i know this messenger  guard   said mr  lorry  getting down into the road  assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers  who immediately scrambled into the coach  shut the door  and pulled up the window   he may come close  there s nothing wrong     i hope there ain t  but i can t make so  nation sure of that   said the guard  in gruff soliloquy   hallo you     well  and hallo you   said jerry  more hoarsely than before    come on at a footpace  d ye mind me  and if you ve got holsters to that saddle o  yourn  don t let me see your hand go nigh  em  for i m a devil at a quick mistake  and when i make one it takes the form of lead  so now let s look at you    the figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist  and came to the side of the mail  where the passenger stood  the rider stooped  and  casting up his eyes at the guard  handed the passenger a small folded paper  the rider s horse was blown  and both horse and rider were covered with mud  from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man    guard   said the passenger  in a tone of quiet business confidence   the watchful guard  with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss  his left at the barrel  and his eye on the horseman  answered curtly   sir     there is nothing to apprehend  i belong to tellson s bank  you must know tellson s bank in london  i am going to paris on business  a crown to drink  i may read this     if so be as you re quick  sir    he opened it in the light of the coach lamp on that side  and read  first to himself and then aloud    wait at dover for mam selle   it s not long  you see  guard  jerry  say that my answer was  recalled to life    jerry started in his saddle   that s a blazing strange answer  too    said he  at his hoarsest    take that message back  and they will know that i received this  as well as if i wrote  make the best of your way  good night    with those words the passenger opened the coach door and got in  not at all assisted by his fellow passengers  who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots  and were now making a general pretence of being asleep  with no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action   the coach lumbered on again  with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent  the guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm chest  and  having looked to the rest of its contents  and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt  looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat  in which there were a few smith s tools  a couple of torches  and a tinder box  for he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach lamps had been blown and stormed out  which did occasionally happen  he had only to shut himself up inside  keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw  and get a light with tolerable safety and ease  if he were lucky  in five minutes    tom   softly over the coach roof    hallo  joe     did you hear the message     i did  joe     what did you make of it  tom     nothing at all  joe     that s a coincidence  too   the guard mused   for i made the same of it myself    jerry  left alone in the mist and darkness  dismounted meanwhile  not only to ease his spent horse  but to wipe the mud from his face  and shake the wet out of his hat brim  which might be capable of holding about half a gallon  after standing with the bridle over his heavily splashed arm  until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again  he turned to walk down the hill    after that there gallop from temple bar  old lady  i won t trust your fore legs till i get you on the level   said this hoarse messenger  glancing at his mare    recalled to life   that s a blazing strange message  much of that wouldn t do for you  jerry  i say  jerry  you d be in a blazing bad way  if recalling to life was to come into fashion  jerry       iii  the night shadows   a wonderful fact to reflect upon  that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other  a solemn consideration  when i enter a great city by night  that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret  that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret  that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there  is  in some of its imaginings  a secret to the heart nearest it  something of the awfulness  even of death itself  is referable to this  no more can i turn the leaves of this dear book that i loved  and vainly hope in time to read it all  no more can i look into the depths of this unfathomable water  wherein  as momentary lights glanced into it  i have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged  it was appointed that the book should shut with a spring  for ever and for ever  when i had read but a page  it was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost  when the light was playing on its surface  and i stood in ignorance on the shore  my friend is dead  my neighbour is dead  my love  the darling of my soul  is dead  it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality  and which i shall carry in mine to my life s end  in any of the burial places of this city through which i pass  is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are  in their innermost personality  to me  or than i am to them   as to this  his natural and not to be alienated inheritance  the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the king  the first minister of state  or the richest merchant in london  so with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach  they were mysteries to one another  as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six  or his own coach and sixty  with the breadth of a county between him and the next   the messenger rode back at an easy trot  stopping pretty often at ale houses by the way to drink  but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel  and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes  he had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration  being of a surface black  with no depth in the colour or form  and much too near together  as if they were afraid of being found out in something  singly  if they kept too far apart  they had a sinister expression  under an old cocked hat like a three cornered spittoon  and over a great muffler for the chin and throat  which descended nearly to the wearer s knees  when he stopped for drink  he moved this muffler with his left hand  only while he poured his liquor in with his right  as soon as that was done  he muffled again    no  jerry  no   said the messenger  harping on one theme as he rode   it wouldn t do for you  jerry  jerry  you honest tradesman  it wouldn t suit your line of business  recalled    bust me if i don t think he d been a drinking    his message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain  several times  to take off his hat to scratch his head  except on the crown  which was raggedly bald  he had stiff  black hair  standing jaggedly all over it  and growing down hill almost to his broad  blunt nose  it was so like smith s work  so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair  that the best of players at leap frog might have declined him  as the most dangerous man in the world to go over   while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of tellson s bank  by temple bar  who was to deliver it to greater authorities within  the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message  and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness  they seemed to be numerous  for she shied at every shadow on the road   what time  the mail coach lumbered  jolted  rattled  and bumped upon its tedious way  with its three fellow inscrutables inside  to whom  likewise  the shadows of the night revealed themselves  in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested   tellson s bank had a run upon it in the mail  as the bank passenger  with an arm drawn through the leathern strap  which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger  and driving him into his corner  whenever the coach got a special jolt  nodded in his place  with half shut eyes  the little coach windows  and the coach lamp dimly gleaming through them  and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger  became the bank  and did a great stroke of business  the rattle of the harness was the chink of money  and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even tellson s  with all its foreign and home connection  ever paid in thrice the time  then the strong rooms underground  at tellson s  with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger  and it was not a little that he knew about them   opened before him  and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly burning candle  and found them safe  and strong  and sound  and still  just as he had last seen them   but  though the bank was almost always with him  and though the coach  in a confused way  like the presence of pain under an opiate  was always with him  there was another current of impression that never ceased to run  all through the night  he was on his way to dig some one out of a grave   now  which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person  the shadows of the night did not indicate  but they were all the faces of a man of five and forty by years  and they differed principally in the passions they expressed  and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state  pride  contempt  defiance  stubbornness  submission  lamentation  succeeded one another  so did varieties of sunken cheek  cadaverous colour  emaciated hands and figures  but the face was in the main one face  and every head was prematurely white  a hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre    buried how long    the answer was always the same   almost eighteen years     you had abandoned all hope of being dug out     long ago     you know that you are recalled to life     they tell me so     i hope you care to live     i can t say     shall i show her to you  will you come and see her    the answers to this question were various and contradictory  sometimes the broken reply was   wait  it would kill me if i saw her too soon    sometimes  it was given in a tender rain of tears  and then it was   take me to her   sometimes it was staring and bewildered  and then it was   i don t know her  i don t understand    after such imaginary discourse  the passenger in his fancy would dig  and dig  dig  now with a spade  now with a great key  now with his hands  to dig this wretched creature out  got out at last  with earth hanging about his face and hair  he would suddenly fan away to dust  the passenger would then start to himself  and lower the window  to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek   yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain  on the moving patch of light from the lamps  and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks  the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within  the real banking house by temple bar  the real business of the past day  the real strong rooms  the real express sent after him  and the real message returned  would all be there  out of the midst of them  the ghostly face would rise  and he would accost it again    buried how long     almost eighteen years     i hope you care to live     i can t say    dig  dig  dig  until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window  draw his arm securely through the leathern strap  and speculate upon the two slumbering forms  until his mind lost its hold of them  and they again slid away into the bank and the grave    buried how long     almost eighteen years     you had abandoned all hope of being dug out     long ago    the words were still in his hearing as just spoken  distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life  when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight  and found that the shadows of the night were gone   he lowered the window  and looked out at the rising sun  there was a ridge of ploughed land  with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked  beyond  a quiet coppice wood  in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees  though the earth was cold and wet  the sky was clear  and the sun rose bright  placid  and beautiful    eighteen years   said the passenger  looking at the sun   gracious creator of day  to be buried alive for eighteen years       iv  the preparation   when the mail got successfully to dover  in the course of the forenoon  the head drawer at the royal george hotel opened the coach door as his custom was  he did it with some flourish of ceremony  for a mail journey from london in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon   by that time  there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated  for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations  the mildewy inside of the coach  with its damp and dirty straw  its disagreeable smell  and its obscurity  was rather like a larger dog kennel  mr  lorry  the passenger  shaking himself out of it in chains of straw  a tangle of shaggy wrapper  flapping hat  and muddy legs  was rather like a larger sort of dog    there will be a packet to calais  tomorrow  drawer     yes  sir  if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair  the tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon  sir  bed  sir     i shall not go to bed till night  but i want a bedroom  and a barber     and then breakfast  sir  yes  sir  that way  sir  if you please  show concord  gentleman s valise and hot water to concord  pull off gentleman s boots in concord   you will find a fine sea coal fire  sir   fetch barber to concord  stir about there  now  for concord    the concord bed chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail  and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot  the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the royal george  that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it  all kinds and varieties of men came out of it  consequently  another drawer  and two porters  and several maids and the landlady  were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the concord and the coffee room  when a gentleman of sixty  formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes  pretty well worn  but very well kept  with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets  passed along on his way to his breakfast   the coffee room had no other occupant  that forenoon  than the gentleman in brown  his breakfast table was drawn before the fire  and as he sat  with its light shining on him  waiting for the meal  he sat so still  that he might have been sitting for his portrait   very orderly and methodical he looked  with a hand on each knee  and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist coat  as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire  he had a good leg  and was a little vain of it  for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close  and were of a fine texture  his shoes and buckles  too  though plain  were trim  he wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig  setting very close to his head  which wig  it is to be presumed  was made of hair  but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass  his linen  though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings  was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach  or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea  a face habitually suppressed and quieted  was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner  in years gone by  some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of tellson s bank  he had a healthy colour in his cheeks  and his face  though lined  bore few traces of anxiety  but  perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in tellson s bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people  and perhaps second hand cares  like second hand clothes  come easily off and on   completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait  mr  lorry dropped off to sleep  the arrival of his breakfast roused him  and he said to the drawer  as he moved his chair to it    i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to day  she may ask for mr  jarvis lorry  or she may only ask for a gentleman from tellson s bank  please to let me know     yes  sir  tellson s bank in london  sir     yes     yes  sir  we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and paris  sir  a vast deal of travelling  sir  in tellson and company s house     yes  we are quite a french house  as well as an english one     yes  sir  not much in the habit of such travelling yourself  i think  sir     not of late years  it is fifteen years since we  since i  came last from france     indeed  sir  that was before my time here  sir  before our people s time here  sir  the george was in other hands at that time  sir     i believe so     but i would hold a pretty wager  sir  that a house like tellson and company was flourishing  a matter of fifty  not to speak of fifteen years ago     you might treble that  and say a hundred and fifty  yet not be far from the truth     indeed  sir    rounding his mouth and both his eyes  as he stepped backward from the table  the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left  dropped into a comfortable attitude  and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank  as from an observatory or watchtower  according to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages   when mr  lorry had finished his breakfast  he went out for a stroll on the beach  the little narrow  crooked town of dover hid itself away from the beach  and ran its head into the chalk cliffs  like a marine ostrich  the beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about  and the sea did what it liked  and what it liked was destruction  it thundered at the town  and thundered at the cliffs  and brought the coast down  madly  the air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it  as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea  a little fishing was done in the port  and a quantity of strolling about by night  and looking seaward  particularly at those times when the tide made  and was near flood  small tradesmen  who did no business whatever  sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes  and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter   as the day declined into the afternoon  and the air  which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the french coast to be seen  became again charged with mist and vapour  mr  lorry s thoughts seemed to cloud too  when it was dark  and he sat before the coffee room fire  awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast  his mind was busily digging  digging  digging  in the live red coals   a bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm  otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work  mr  lorry had been idle a long time  and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle  when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street  and rumbled into the inn yard   he set down his glass untouched   this is mam selle   said he   in a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that miss manette had arrived from london  and would be happy to see the gentleman from tellson s    so soon    miss manette had taken some refreshment on the road  and required none then  and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from tellson s immediately  if it suited his pleasure and convenience   the gentleman from tellson s had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation  settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears  and follow the waiter to miss manette s apartment  it was a large  dark room  furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair  and loaded with heavy dark tables  these had been oiled and oiled  until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf  as if they were buried  in deep graves of black mahogany  and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out   the obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that mr  lorry  picking his way over the well worn turkey carpet  supposed miss manette to be  for the moment  in some adjacent room  until  having got past the two tall candles  he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire  a young lady of not more than seventeen  in a riding cloak  and still holding her straw travelling hat by its ribbon in her hand  as his eyes rested on a short  slight  pretty figure  a quantity of golden hair  a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look  and a forehead with a singular capacity  remembering how young and smooth it was   of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity  or wonder  or alarm  or merely of a bright fixed attention  though it included all the four expressions  as his eyes rested on these things  a sudden vivid likeness passed before him  of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very channel  one cold time  when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high  the likeness passed away  like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier glass behind her  on the frame of which  a hospital procession of negro cupids  several headless and all cripples  were offering black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender  and he made his formal bow to miss manette    pray take a seat  sir   in a very clear and pleasant young voice  a little foreign in its accent  but a very little indeed    i kiss your hand  miss   said mr  lorry  with the manners of an earlier date  as he made his formal bow again  and took his seat    i received a letter from the bank  sir  yesterday  informing me that some intelligence  or discovery      the word is not material  miss  either word will do       respecting the small property of my poor father  whom i never saw  so long dead     mr  lorry moved in his chair  and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids  as if they had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets      rendered it necessary that i should go to paris  there to communicate with a gentleman of the bank  so good as to be despatched to paris for the purpose     myself     as i was prepared to hear  sir    she curtseyed to him  young ladies made curtseys in those days   with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she  he made her another bow    i replied to the bank  sir  that as it was considered necessary  by those who know  and who are so kind as to advise me  that i should go to france  and that as i am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me  i should esteem it highly if i might be permitted to place myself  during the journey  under that worthy gentleman s protection  the gentleman had left london  but i think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here     i was happy   said mr  lorry   to be entrusted with the charge  i shall be more happy to execute it     sir  i thank you indeed  i thank you very gratefully  it was told me by the bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business  and that i must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature  i have done my best to prepare myself  and i naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are     naturally   said mr  lorry   yes  i     after a pause  he added  again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears   it is very difficult to begin    he did not begin  but  in his indecision  met her glance  the young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression  but it was pretty and characteristic  besides being singular  and she raised her hand  as if with an involuntary action she caught at  or stayed some passing shadow    are you quite a stranger to me  sir     am i not   mr  lorry opened his hands  and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile   between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose  the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be  the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing  he watched her as she mused  and the moment she raised her eyes again  went on    in your adopted country  i presume  i cannot do better than address you as a young english lady  miss manette     if you please  sir     miss manette  i am a man of business  i have a business charge to acquit myself of  in your reception of it  don t heed me any more than if i was a speaking machine  truly  i am not much else  i will  with your leave  relate to you  miss  the story of one of our customers     story    he seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated  when he added  in a hurry   yes  customers  in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers  he was a french gentleman  a scientific gentleman  a man of great acquirements  a doctor     not of beauvais     why  yes  of beauvais  like monsieur manette  your father  the gentleman was of beauvais  like monsieur manette  your father  the gentleman was of repute in paris  i had the honour of knowing him there  our relations were business relations  but confidential  i was at that time in our french house  and had been  oh  twenty years     at that time  i may ask  at what time  sir     i speak  miss  of twenty years ago  he married  an english lady  and i was one of the trustees  his affairs  like the affairs of many other french gentlemen and french families  were entirely in tellson s hands  in a similar way i am  or i have been  trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers  these are mere business relations  miss  there is no friendship in them  no particular interest  nothing like sentiment  i have passed from one to another  in the course of my business life  just as i pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day  in short  i have no feelings  i am a mere machine  to go on      but this is my father s story  sir  and i begin to think   the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him   that when i was left an orphan through my mother s surviving my father only two years  it was you who brought me to england  i am almost sure it was you    mr  lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his  and he put it with some ceremony to his lips  he then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again  and  holding the chair back with his left hand  and using his right by turns to rub his chin  pull his wig at the ears  or point what he said  stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his    miss manette  it was i  and you will see how truly i spoke of myself just now  in saying i had no feelings  and that all the relations i hold with my fellow creatures are mere business relations  when you reflect that i have never seen you since  no  you have been the ward of tellson s house since  and i have been busy with the other business of tellson s house since  feelings  i have no time for them  no chance of them  i pass my whole life  miss  in turning an immense pecuniary mangle    after this odd description of his daily routine of employment  mr  lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands  which was most unnecessary  for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before   and resumed his former attitude    so far  miss  as you have remarked   this is the story of your regretted father  now comes the difference  if your father had not died when he did  don t be frightened  how you start    she did  indeed  start  and she caught his wrist with both her hands    pray   said mr  lorry  in a soothing tone  bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble   pray control your agitation  a matter of business  as i was saying     her look so discomposed him that he stopped  wandered  and began anew    as i was saying  if monsieur manette had not died  if he had suddenly and silently disappeared  if he had been spirited away  if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place  though no art could trace him  if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that i in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper  across the water there  for instance  the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time  if his wife had implored the king  the queen  the court  the clergy  for any tidings of him  and all quite in vain   then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman  the doctor of beauvais     i entreat you to tell me more  sir     i will  i am going to  you can bear it     i can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment     you speak collectedly  and you  are collected  that s good    though his manner was less satisfied than his words    a matter of business  regard it as a matter of business  business that must be done  now if this doctor s wife  though a lady of great courage and spirit  had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born      the little child was a daughter  sir     a daughter  a a matter of business  don t be distressed  miss  if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born  that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of  by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead  no  don t kneel  in heaven s name why should you kneel to me     for the truth  o dear  good  compassionate sir  for the truth     a  a matter of business  you confuse me  and how can i transact business if i am confused  let us be clear headed  if you could kindly mention now  for instance  what nine times ninepence are  or how many shillings in twenty guineas  it would be so encouraging  i should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind    without directly answering to this appeal  she sat so still when he had very gently raised her  and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been  that she communicated some reassurance to mr  jarvis lorry    that s right  that s right  courage  business  you have business before you  useful business  miss manette  your mother took this course with you  and when she died  i believe broken hearted  having never slackened her unavailing search for your father  she left you  at two years old  to grow to be blooming  beautiful  and happy  without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison  or wasted there through many lingering years    as he said the words he looked down  with an admiring pity  on the flowing golden hair  as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey    you know that your parents had no great possession  and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you  there has been no new discovery  of money  or of any other property  but     he felt his wrist held closer  and he stopped  the expression in the forehead  which had so particularly attracted his notice  and which was now immovable  had deepened into one of pain and horror    but he has been  been found  he is alive  greatly changed  it is too probable  almost a wreck  it is possible  though we will hope the best  still  alive  your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in paris  and we are going there  i  to identify him if i can  you  to restore him to life  love  duty  rest  comfort    a shiver ran through her frame  and from it through his  she said  in a low  distinct  awe stricken voice  as if she were saying it in a dream    i am going to see his ghost  it will be his ghost  not him    mr  lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm   there  there  there  see now  see now  the best and the worst are known to you  now  you are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman  and  with a fair sea voyage  and a fair land journey  you will be soon at his dear side    she repeated in the same tone  sunk to a whisper   i have been free  i have been happy  yet his ghost has never haunted me     only one thing more   said mr  lorry  laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention   he has been found under another name  his own  long forgotten or long concealed  it would be worse than useless now to inquire which  worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked  or always designedly held prisoner  it would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries  because it would be dangerous  better not to mention the subject  anywhere or in any way  and to remove him  for a while at all events  out of france  even i  safe as an englishman  and even tellson s  important as they are to french credit  avoid all naming of the matter  i carry about me  not a scrap of writing openly referring to it  this is a secret service altogether  my credentials  entries  and memoranda  are all comprehended in the one line   recalled to life   which may mean anything  but what is the matter  she doesn t notice a word  miss manette    perfectly still and silent  and not even fallen back in her chair  she sat under his hand  utterly insensible  with her eyes open and fixed upon him  and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead  so close was her hold upon his arm  that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her  therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving   a wild looking woman  whom even in his agitation  mr  lorry observed to be all of a red colour  and to have red hair  and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight fitting fashion  and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure  and good measure too  or a great stilton cheese  came running into the room in advance of the inn servants  and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady  by laying a brawny hand upon his chest  and sending him flying back against the nearest wall     i really think this must be a man   was mr  lorry s breathless reflection  simultaneously with his coming against the wall     why  look at you all   bawled this figure  addressing the inn servants   why don t you go and fetch things  instead of standing there staring at me  i am not so much to look at  am i  why don t you go and fetch things  i ll let you know  if you don t bring smelling salts  cold water  and vinegar  quick  i will    there was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives  and she softly laid the patient on a sofa  and tended her with great skill and gentleness  calling her  my precious   and  my bird   and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care    and you in brown   she said  indignantly turning to mr  lorry   couldn t you tell her what you had to tell her  without frightening her to death  look at her  with her pretty pale face and her cold hands  do you call that being a banker    mr  lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer  that he could only look on  at a distance  with much feebler sympathy and humility  while the strong woman  having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of  letting them know  something not mentioned if they stayed there  staring  recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations  and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder    i hope she will do well now   said mr  lorry    no thanks to you in brown  if she does  my darling pretty     i hope   said mr  lorry  after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility   that you accompany miss manette to france     a likely thing  too   replied the strong woman   if it was ever intended that i should go across salt water  do you suppose providence would have cast my lot in an island    this being another question hard to answer  mr  jarvis lorry withdrew to consider it      v  the wine shop   a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken  in the street  the accident had happened in getting it out of a cart  the cask had tumbled out with a run  the hoops had burst  and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine shop  shattered like a walnut shell   all the people within reach had suspended their business  or their idleness  to run to the spot and drink the wine  the rough  irregular stones of the street  pointing every way  and designed  one might have thought  expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them  had dammed it into little pools  these were surrounded  each by its own jostling group or crowd  according to its size  some men kneeled down  made scoops of their two hands joined  and sipped  or tried to help women  who bent over their shoulders  to sip  before the wine had all run out between their fingers  others  men and women  dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware  or even with handkerchiefs from women s heads  which were squeezed dry into infants  mouths  others made small mud embankments  to stem the wine as it ran  others  directed by lookers on up at high windows  darted here and there  to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions  others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee dyed pieces of the cask  licking  and even champing the moister wine rotted fragments with eager relish  there was no drainage to carry off the wine  and not only did it all get taken up  but so much mud got taken up along with it  that there might have been a scavenger in the street  if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence   a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices  voices of men  women  and children  resounded in the street while this wine game lasted  there was little roughness in the sport  and much playfulness  there was a special companionship in it  an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one  which led  especially among the luckier or lighter hearted  to frolicsome embraces  drinking of healths  shaking of hands  and even joining of hands and dancing  a dozen together  when the wine was gone  and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron pattern by fingers  these demonstrations ceased  as suddenly as they had broken out  the man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting  set it in motion again  the women who had left on a door step the little pot of hot ashes  at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes  or in those of her child  returned to it  men with bare arms  matted locks  and cadaverous faces  who had emerged into the winter light from cellars  moved away  to descend again  and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine   the wine was red wine  and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of saint antoine  in paris  where it was spilled  it had stained many hands  too  and many faces  and many naked feet  and many wooden shoes  the hands of the man who sawed the wood  left red marks on the billets  and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby  was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again  those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask  had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth  and one tall joker so besmirched  his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it  scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine lees  blood   the time was to come  when that wine too would be spilled on the street stones  and when the stain of it would be red upon many there   and now that the cloud settled on saint antoine  which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance  the darkness of it was heavy  cold  dirt  sickness  ignorance  and want  were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence  nobles of great power all of them  but  most especially the last  samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill  and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young  shivered at every corner  passed in and out at every doorway  looked from every window  fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook  the mill which had worked them down  was the mill that grinds young people old  the children had ancient faces and grave voices  and upon them  and upon the grown faces  and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh  was the sigh  hunger  it was prevalent everywhere  hunger was pushed out of the tall houses  in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines  hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper  hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off  hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys  and started up from the filthy street that had no offal  among its refuse  of anything to eat  hunger was the inscription on the baker s shelves  written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread  at the sausage shop  in every dead dog preparation that was offered for sale  hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder  hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato  fried with some reluctant drops of oil   its abiding place was in all things fitted to it  a narrow winding street  full of offence and stench  with other narrow winding streets diverging  all peopled by rags and nightcaps  and all smelling of rags and nightcaps  and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill  in the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay  depressed and slinking though they were  eyes of fire were not wanting among them  nor compressed lips  white with what they suppressed  nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows rope they mused about enduring  or inflicting  the trade signs  and they were almost as many as the shops  were  all  grim illustrations of want  the butcher and the porkman painted up  only the leanest scrags of meat  the baker  the coarsest of meagre loaves  the people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine shops  croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer  and were gloweringly confidential together  nothing was represented in a flourishing condition  save tools and weapons  but  the cutler s knives and axes were sharp and bright  the smith s hammers were heavy  and the gunmaker s stock was murderous  the crippling stones of the pavement  with their many little reservoirs of mud and water  had no footways  but broke off abruptly at the doors  the kennel  to make amends  ran down the middle of the street  when it ran at all  which was only after heavy rains  and then it ran  by many eccentric fits  into the houses  across the streets  at wide intervals  one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley  at night  when the lamplighter had let these down  and lighted  and hoisted them again  a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead  as if they were at sea  indeed they were at sea  and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest   for  the time was to come  when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter  in their idleness and hunger  so long  as to conceive the idea of improving on his method  and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys  to flare upon the darkness of their condition  but  the time was not come yet  and every wind that blew over france shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain  for the birds  fine of song and feather  took no warning   the wine shop was a corner shop  better than most others in its appearance and degree  and the master of the wine shop had stood outside it  in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches  looking on at the struggle for the lost wine   it s not my affair   said he  with a final shrug of the shoulders   the people from the market did it  let them bring another    there  his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke  he called to him across the way    say  then  my gaspard  what do you do there    the fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance  as is often the way with his tribe  it missed its mark  and completely failed  as is often the way with his tribe too    what now  are you a subject for the mad hospital   said the wine shop keeper  crossing the road  and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud  picked up for the purpose  and smeared over it   why do you write in the public streets  is there  tell me thou  is there no other place to write such words in    in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand  perhaps accidentally  perhaps not  upon the joker s heart  the joker rapped it with his own  took a nimble spring upward  and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude  with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand  and held out  a joker of an extremely  not to say wolfishly practical character  he looked  under those circumstances    put it on  put it on   said the other   call wine  wine  and finish there   with that advice  he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker s dress  such as it was  quite deliberately  as having dirtied the hand on his account  and then recrossed the road and entered the wine shop   this wine shop keeper was a bull necked  martial looking man of thirty  and he should have been of a hot temperament  for  although it was a bitter day  he wore no coat  but carried one slung over his shoulder  his shirt sleeves were rolled up  too  and his brown arms were bare to the elbows  neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply curling short dark hair  he was a dark man altogether  with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them  good humoured looking on the whole  but implacable looking  too  evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose  a man not desirable to be met  rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side  for nothing would turn the man   madame defarge  his wife  sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in  madame defarge was a stout woman of about his own age  with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything  a large hand heavily ringed  a steady face  strong features  and great composure of manner  there was a character about madame defarge  from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided  madame defarge being sensitive to cold  was wrapped in fur  and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head  though not to the concealment of her large earrings  her knitting was before her  but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick  thus engaged  with her right elbow supported by her left hand  madame defarge said nothing when her lord came in  but coughed just one grain of cough  this  in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line  suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers  for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way   the wine shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about  until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady  who were seated in a corner  other company were there  two playing cards  two playing dominoes  three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine  as he passed behind the counter  he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady   this is our man     what the devil do you do in that galley there   said monsieur defarge to himself   i don t know you    but  he feigned not to notice the two strangers  and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter    how goes it  jacques   said one of these three to monsieur defarge   is all the spilt wine swallowed     every drop  jacques   answered monsieur defarge   when this interchange of christian name was effected  madame defarge  picking her teeth with her toothpick  coughed another grain of cough  and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line    it is not often   said the second of the three  addressing monsieur defarge   that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine  or of anything but black bread and death  is it not so  jacques     it is so  jacques   monsieur defarge returned   at this second interchange of the christian name  madame defarge  still using her toothpick with profound composure  coughed another grain of cough  and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line   the last of the three now said his say  as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips    ah  so much the worse  a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths  and hard lives they live  jacques  am i right  jacques     you are right  jacques   was the response of monsieur defarge   this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment when madame defarge put her toothpick by  kept her eyebrows up  and slightly rustled in her seat    hold then  true   muttered her husband   gentlemen  my wife    the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge  with three flourishes  she acknowledged their homage by bending her head  and giving them a quick look  then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine shop  took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit  and became absorbed in it    gentlemen   said her husband  who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her   good day  the chamber  furnished bachelor fashion  that you wished to see  and were inquiring for when i stepped out  is on the fifth floor  the doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here   pointing with his hand   near to the window of my establishment  but  now that i remember  one of you has already been there  and can show the way  gentlemen  adieu    they paid for their wine  and left the place  the eyes of monsieur defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner  and begged the favour of a word    willingly  sir   said monsieur defarge  and quietly stepped with him to the door   their conference was very short  but very decided  almost at the first word  monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive  it had not lasted a minute  when he nodded and went out  the gentleman then beckoned to the young lady  and they  too  went out  madame defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows  and saw nothing   mr  jarvis lorry and miss manette  emerging from the wine shop thus  joined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before  it opened from a stinking little black courtyard  and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses  inhabited by a great number of people  in the gloomy tile paved entry to the gloomy tile paved staircase  monsieur defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master  and put her hand to his lips  it was a gentle action  but not at all gently done  a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds  he had no good humour in his face  nor any openness of aspect left  but had become a secret  angry  dangerous man    it is very high  it is a little difficult  better to begin slowly    thus  monsieur defarge  in a stern voice  to mr  lorry  as they began ascending the stairs    is he alone   the latter whispered    alone  god help him  who should be with him   said the other  in the same low voice    is he always alone  then     yes     of his own desire     of his own necessity  as he was  when i first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if i would take him  and  at my peril be discreet  as he was then  so he is now     he is greatly changed     changed    the keeper of the wine shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand  and mutter a tremendous curse  no direct answer could have been half so forcible  mr  lorry s spirits grew heavier and heavier  as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher   such a staircase  with its accessories  in the older and more crowded parts of paris  would be bad enough now  but  at that time  it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses  every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building  that is to say  the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase  left its own heap of refuse on its own landing  besides flinging other refuse from its own windows  the uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered  would have polluted the air  even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities  the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable  through such an atmosphere  by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison  the way lay  yielding to his own disturbance of mind  and to his young companion s agitation  which became greater every instant  mr  jarvis lorry twice stopped to rest  each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating  by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted  seemed to escape  and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in  through the rusted bars  tastes  rather than glimpses  were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood  and nothing within range  nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of notre dame  had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations   at last  the top of the staircase was gained  and they stopped for the third time  there was yet an upper staircase  of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions  to be ascended  before the garret story was reached  the keeper of the wine shop  always going a little in advance  and always going on the side which mr  lorry took  as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady  turned himself about here  and  carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder  took out a key    the door is locked then  my friend   said mr  lorry  surprised    ay  yes   was the grim reply of monsieur defarge    you think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired     i think it necessary to turn the key   monsieur defarge whispered it closer in his ear  and frowned heavily    why     why  because he has lived so long  locked up  that he would be frightened  rave  tear himself to pieces  die  come to i know not what harm  if his door was left open     is it possible   exclaimed mr  lorry    is it possible   repeated defarge  bitterly   yes  and a beautiful world we live in  when it is possible  and when many other such things are possible  and not only possible  but done  done  see you   under that sky there  every day  long live the devil  let us go on    this dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper  that not a word of it had reached the young lady s ears  but  by this time she trembled under such strong emotion  and her face expressed such deep anxiety  and  above all  such dread and terror  that mr  lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance    courage  dear miss  courage  business  the worst will be over in a moment  it is but passing the room door  and the worst is over  then  all the good you bring to him  all the relief  all the happiness you bring to him  begin  let our good friend here  assist you on that side  that s well  friend defarge  come  now  business  business    they went up slowly and softly  the staircase was short  and they were soon at the top  there  as it had an abrupt turn in it  they came all at once in sight of three men  whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door  and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged  through some chinks or holes in the wall  on hearing footsteps close at hand  these three turned  and rose  and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine shop    i forgot them in the surprise of your visit   explained monsieur defarge   leave us  good boys  we have business here    the three glided by  and went silently down   there appearing to be no other door on that floor  and the keeper of the wine shop going straight to this one when they were left alone  mr  lorry asked him in a whisper  with a little anger    do you make a show of monsieur manette     i show him  in the way you have seen  to a chosen few     is that well     i think it is well     who are the few  how do you choose them     i choose them as real men  of my name  jacques is my name  to whom the sight is likely to do good  enough  you are english  that is another thing  stay there  if you please  a little moment    with an admonitory gesture to keep them back  he stooped  and looked in through the crevice in the wall  soon raising his head again  he struck twice or thrice upon the door  evidently with no other object than to make a noise there  with the same intention  he drew the key across it  three or four times  before he put it clumsily into the lock  and turned it as heavily as he could   the door slowly opened inward under his hand  and he looked into the room and said something  a faint voice answered something  little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side   he looked back over his shoulder  and beckoned them to enter  mr  lorry got his arm securely round the daughter s waist  and held her  for he felt that she was sinking    a a a business  business   he urged  with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek   come in  come in     i am afraid of it   she answered  shuddering    of it  what     i mean of him  of my father    rendered in a manner desperate  by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor  he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder  lifted her a little  and hurried her into the room  he sat her down just within the door  and held her  clinging to him   defarge drew out the key  closed the door  locked it on the inside  took out the key again  and held it in his hand  all this he did  methodically  and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make  finally  he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was  he stopped there  and faced round   the garret  built to be a depository for firewood and the like  was dim and dark  for  the window of dormer shape  was in truth a door in the roof  with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street  unglazed  and closing up the middle in two pieces  like any other door of french construction  to exclude the cold  one half of this door was fast closed  and the other was opened but a very little way  such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means  that it was difficult  on first coming in  to see anything  and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one  the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity  yet  work of that kind was being done in the garret  for  with his back towards the door  and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine shop stood looking at him  a white haired man sat on a low bench  stooping forward and very busy  making shoes      vi  the shoemaker    good day   said monsieur defarge  looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking   it was raised for a moment  and a very faint voice responded to the salutation  as if it were at a distance    good day     you are still hard at work  i see    after a long silence  the head was lifted for another moment  and the voice replied   yes  i am working   this time  a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner  before the face had dropped again   the faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful  it was not the faintness of physical weakness  though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it  its deplorable peculiarity was  that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse  it was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago  so entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice  that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain  so sunken and suppressed it was  that it was like a voice underground  so expressive it was  of a hopeless and lost creature  that a famished traveller  wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness  would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die   some minutes of silent work had passed  and the haggard eyes had looked up again  not with any interest or curiosity  but with a dull mechanical perception  beforehand  that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood  was not yet empty    i want   said defarge  who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker   to let in a little more light here  you can bear a little more    the shoemaker stopped his work  looked with a vacant air of listening  at the floor on one side of him  then similarly  at the floor on the other side of him  then  upward at the speaker    what did you say     you can bear a little more light     i must bear it  if you let it in    laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word    the opened half door was opened a little further  and secured at that angle for the time  a broad ray of light fell into the garret  and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap  pausing in his labour  his few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench  he had a white beard  raggedly cut  but not very long  a hollow face  and exceedingly bright eyes  the hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large  under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair  though they had been really otherwise  but  they were naturally large  and looked unnaturally so  his yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat  and showed his body to be withered and worn  he  and his old canvas frock  and his loose stockings  and all his poor tatters of clothes  had  in a long seclusion from direct light and air  faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment yellow  that it would have been hard to say which was which   he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light  and the very bones of it seemed transparent  so he sat  with a steadfastly vacant gaze  pausing in his work  he never looked at the figure before him  without first looking down on this side of himself  then on that  as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound  he never spoke  without first wandering in this manner  and forgetting to speak    are you going to finish that pair of shoes to day   asked defarge  motioning to mr  lorry to come forward    what did you say     do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to day     i can t say that i mean to  i suppose so  i don t know    but  the question reminded him of his work  and he bent over it again   mr  lorry came silently forward  leaving the daughter by the door  when he had stood  for a minute or two  by the side of defarge  the shoemaker looked up  he showed no surprise at seeing another figure  but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it  his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead colour   and then the hand dropped to his work  and he once more bent over the shoe  the look and the action had occupied but an instant    you have a visitor  you see   said monsieur defarge    what did you say     here is a visitor    the shoemaker looked up as before  but without removing a hand from his work    come   said defarge   here is monsieur  who knows a well made shoe when he sees one  show him that shoe you are working at  take it  monsieur    mr  lorry took it in his hand    tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is  and the maker s name    there was a longer pause than usual  before the shoemaker replied    i forget what it was you asked me  what did you say     i said  couldn t you describe the kind of shoe  for monsieur s information     it is a lady s shoe  it is a young lady s walking shoe  it is in the present mode  i never saw the mode  i have had a pattern in my hand   he glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride    and the maker s name   said defarge   now that he had no work to hold  he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left  and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right  and then passed a hand across his bearded chin  and so on in regular changes  without a moment s intermission  the task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken  was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon  or endeavouring  in the hope of some disclosure  to stay the spirit of a fast dying man    did you ask me for my name     assuredly i did     one hundred and five  north tower     is that all     one hundred and five  north tower    with a weary sound that was not a sigh  nor a groan  he bent to work again  until the silence was again broken    you are not a shoemaker by trade   said mr  lorry  looking steadfastly at him   his haggard eyes turned to defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him  but as no help came from that quarter  they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground    i am not a shoemaker by trade  no  i was not a shoemaker by trade  i i learnt it here  i taught myself  i asked leave to     he lapsed away  even for minutes  ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time  his eyes came slowly back  at last  to the face from which they had wandered  when they rested on it  he started  and resumed  in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake  reverting to a subject of last night    i asked leave to teach myself  and i got it with much difficulty after a long while  and i have made shoes ever since    as he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him  mr  lorry said  still looking steadfastly in his face    monsieur manette  do you remember nothing of me    the shoe dropped to the ground  and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner    monsieur manette   mr  lorry laid his hand upon defarge s arm   do you remember nothing of this man  look at him  look at me  is there no old banker  no old business  no old servant  no old time  rising in your mind  monsieur manette    as the captive of many years sat looking fixedly  by turns  at mr  lorry and at defarge  some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead  gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him  they were overclouded again  they were fainter  they were gone  but they had been there  and so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him  and where she now stood looking at him  with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion  if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him  but which were now extending towards him  trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast  and love it back to life and hope  so exactly was the expression repeated  though in stronger characters  on her fair young face  that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light  from him to her   darkness had fallen on him in its place  he looked at the two  less and less attentively  and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way  finally  with a deep long sigh  he took the shoe up  and resumed his work    have you recognised him  monsieur   asked defarge in a whisper    yes  for a moment  at first i thought it quite hopeless  but i have unquestionably seen  for a single moment  the face that i once knew so well  hush  let us draw further back  hush    she had moved from the wall of the garret  very near to the bench on which he sat  there was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour   not a word was spoken  not a sound was made  she stood  like a spirit  beside him  and he bent over his work   it happened  at length  that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand  for his shoemaker s knife  it lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood  he had taken it up  and was stooping to work again  when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress  he raised them  and saw her face  the two spectators started forward  but she stayed them with a motion of her hand  she had no fear of his striking at her with the knife  though they had   he stared at her with a fearful look  and after a while his lips began to form some words  though no sound proceeded from them  by degrees  in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing  he was heard to say    what is this    with the tears streaming down her face  she put her two hands to her lips  and kissed them to him  then clasped them on her breast  as if she laid his ruined head there    you are not the gaoler s daughter    she sighed  no     who are you    not yet trusting the tones of her voice  she sat down on the bench beside him  he recoiled  but she laid her hand upon his arm  a strange thrill struck him when she did so  and visibly passed over his frame  he laid the knife down softly  as he sat staring at her   her golden hair  which she wore in long curls  had been hurriedly pushed aside  and fell down over her neck  advancing his hand by little and little  he took it up and looked at it  in the midst of the action he went astray  and  with another deep sigh  fell to work at his shoemaking   but not for long  releasing his arm  she laid her hand upon his shoulder  after looking doubtfully at it  two or three times  as if to be sure that it was really there  he laid down his work  put his hand to his neck  and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it  he opened this  carefully  on his knee  and it contained a very little quantity of hair  not more than one or two long golden hairs  which he had  in some old day  wound off upon his finger   he took her hair into his hand again  and looked closely at it   it is the same  how can it be  when was it  how was it    as the concentrated expression returned to his forehead  he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too  he turned her full to the light  and looked at her    she had laid her head upon my shoulder  that night when i was summoned out  she had a fear of my going  though i had none  and when i was brought to the north tower they found these upon my sleeve   you will leave me them  they can never help me to escape in the body  though they may in the spirit   those were the words i said  i remember them very well    he formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it  but when he did find spoken words for it  they came to him coherently  though slowly    how was this   was it you    once more  the two spectators started  as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness  but she sat perfectly still in his grasp  and only said  in a low voice   i entreat you  good gentlemen  do not come near us  do not speak  do not move     hark   he exclaimed   whose voice was that    his hands released her as he uttered this cry  and went up to his white hair  which they tore in a frenzy  it died out  as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him  and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast  but he still looked at her  and gloomily shook his head    no  no  no  you are too young  too blooming  it can t be  see what the prisoner is  these are not the hands she knew  this is not the face she knew  this is not a voice she ever heard  no  no  she was  and he was  before the slow years of the north tower  ages ago  what is your name  my gentle angel    hailing his softened tone and manner  his daughter fell upon her knees before him  with her appealing hands upon his breast    o  sir  at another time you shall know my name  and who my mother was  and who my father  and how i never knew their hard  hard history  but i cannot tell you at this time  and i cannot tell you here  all that i may tell you  here and now  is  that i pray to you to touch me and to bless me  kiss me  kiss me  o my dear  my dear    his cold white head mingled with her radiant hair  which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of freedom shining on him    if you hear in my voice  i don t know that it is so  but i hope it is  if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears  weep for it  weep for it  if you touch  in touching my hair  anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free  weep for it  weep for it  if  when i hint to you of a home that is before us  where i will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service  i bring back the remembrance of a home long desolate  while your poor heart pined away  weep for it  weep for it    she held him closer round the neck  and rocked him on her breast like a child    if  when i tell you  dearest dear  that your agony is over  and that i have come here to take you from it  and that we go to england to be at peace and at rest  i cause you to think of your useful life laid waste  and of our native france so wicked to you  weep for it  weep for it  and if  when i shall tell you of my name  and of my father who is living  and of my mother who is dead  you learn that i have to kneel to my honoured father  and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night  because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me  weep for it  weep for it  weep for her  then  and for me  good gentlemen  thank god  i feel his sacred tears upon my face  and his sobs strike against my heart  o  see  thank god for us  thank god    he had sunk in her arms  and his face dropped on her breast  a sight so touching  yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it  that the two beholders covered their faces   when the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed  and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all storms  emblem to humanity  of the rest and silence into which the storm called life must hush at last  they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground  he had gradually dropped to the floor  and lay there in a lethargy  worn out  she had nestled down with him  that his head might lie upon her arm  and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light    if  without disturbing him   she said  raising her hand to mr  lorry as he stooped over them  after repeated blowings of his nose   all could be arranged for our leaving paris at once  so that  from the very door  he could be taken away      but  consider  is he fit for the journey   asked mr  lorry    more fit for that  i think  than to remain in this city  so dreadful to him     it is true   said defarge  who was kneeling to look on and hear   more than that  monsieur manette is  for all reasons  best out of france  say  shall i hire a carriage and post horses     that s business   said mr  lorry  resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners   and if business is to be done  i had better do it     then be so kind   urged miss manette   as to leave us here  you see how composed he has become  and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now  why should you be  if you will lock the door to secure us from interruption  i do not doubt that you will find him  when you come back  as quiet as you leave him  in any case  i will take care of him until you return  and then we will remove him straight    both mr  lorry and defarge were rather disinclined to this course  and in favour of one of them remaining  but  as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to  but travelling papers  and as time pressed  for the day was drawing to an end  it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done  and hurrying away to do it   then  as the darkness closed in  the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father s side  and watched him  the darkness deepened and deepened  and they both lay quiet  until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall   mr  lorry and monsieur defarge had made all ready for the journey  and had brought with them  besides travelling cloaks and wrappers  bread and meat  wine  and hot coffee  monsieur defarge put this provender  and the lamp he carried  on the shoemaker s bench  there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed   and he and mr  lorry roused the captive  and assisted him to his feet   no human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind  in the scared blank wonder of his face  whether he knew what had happened  whether he recollected what they had said to him  whether he knew that he was free  were questions which no sagacity could have solved  they tried speaking to him  but  he was so confused  and so very slow to answer  that they took fright at his bewilderment  and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more  he had a wild  lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands  that had not been seen in him before  yet  he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter s voice  and invariably turned to it when she spoke   in the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion  he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink  and put on the cloak and other wrappings  that they gave him to wear  he readily responded to his daughter s drawing her arm through his  and took  and kept  her hand in both his own   they began to descend  monsieur defarge going first with the lamp  mr  lorry closing the little procession  they had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped  and stared at the roof and round at the walls    you remember the place  my father  you remember coming up here     what did you say    but  before she could repeat the question  he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it    remember  no  i don t remember  it was so very long ago    that he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house  was apparent to them  they heard him mutter   one hundred and five  north tower   and when he looked about him  it evidently was for the strong fortress walls which had long encompassed him  on their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread  as being in expectation of a drawbridge  and when there was no drawbridge  and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street  he dropped his daughter s hand and clasped his head again   no crowd was about the door  no people were discernible at any of the many windows  not even a chance passerby was in the street  an unnatural silence and desertion reigned there  only one soul was to be seen  and that was madame defarge  who leaned against the door post  knitting  and saw nothing   the prisoner had got into a coach  and his daughter had followed him  when mr  lorry s feet were arrested on the step by his asking  miserably  for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes  madame defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them  and went  knitting  out of the lamplight  through the courtyard  she quickly brought them down and handed them in   and immediately afterwards leaned against the door post  knitting  and saw nothing   defarge got upon the box  and gave the word  to the barrier   the postilion cracked his whip  and they clattered away under the feeble over swinging lamps   under the over swinging lamps  swinging ever brighter in the better streets  and ever dimmer in the worse  and by lighted shops  gay crowds  illuminated coffee houses  and theatre doors  to one of the city gates  soldiers with lanterns  at the guard house there   your papers  travellers    see here then  monsieur the officer   said defarge  getting down  and taking him gravely apart   these are the papers of monsieur inside  with the white head  they were consigned to me  with him  at the    he dropped his voice  there was a flutter among the military lanterns  and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform  the eyes connected with the arm looked  not an every day or an every night look  at monsieur with the white head   it is well  forward   from the uniform   adieu   from defarge  and so  under a short grove of feebler and feebler over swinging lamps  out under the great grove of stars   beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights  some  so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it  as a point in space where anything is suffered or done  the shadows of the night were broad and black  all through the cold and restless interval  until dawn  they once more whispered in the ears of mr  jarvis lorry  sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out  and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him  and what were capable of restoration  the old inquiry    i hope you care to be recalled to life    and the old answer    i can t say     the end of the first book      book the second  the golden thread     i  five years later   tellson s bank by temple bar was an old fashioned place  even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty  it was very small  very dark  very ugly  very incommodious  it was an old fashioned place  moreover  in the moral attribute that the partners in the house were proud of its smallness  proud of its darkness  proud of its ugliness  proud of its incommodiousness  they were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars  and were fired by an express conviction that  if it were less objectionable  it would be less respectable  this was no passive belief  but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business  tellson s  they said  wanted no elbow room  tellson s wanted no light  tellson s wanted no embellishment  noakes and co  s might  or snooks brothers  might  but tellson s  thank heaven     any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding tellson s  in this respect the house was much on a par with the country  which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable  but were only the more respectable   thus it had come to pass  that tellson s was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience  after bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat  you fell into tellson s down two steps  and came to your senses in a miserable little shop  with two little counters  where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it  while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows  which were always under a shower bath of mud from fleet street  and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper  and the heavy shadow of temple bar  if your business necessitated your seeing  the house   you were put into a species of condemned hold at the back  where you meditated on a misspent life  until the house came with its hands in its pockets  and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight  your money came out of  or went into  wormy old wooden drawers  particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut  your bank notes had a musty odour  as if they were fast decomposing into rags again  your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools  and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two  your deeds got into extemporised strong rooms made of kitchens and sculleries  and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking house air  your lighter boxes of family papers went up stairs into a barmecide room  that always had a great dining table in it and never had a dinner  and where  even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty  the first letters written to you by your old love  or by your little children  were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows  by the heads exposed on temple bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of abyssinia or ashantee   but indeed  at that time  putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions  and not least of all with tellson s  death is nature s remedy for all things  and why not legislation s  accordingly  the forger was put to death  the utterer of a bad note was put to death  the unlawful opener of a letter was put to death  the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to death  the holder of a horse at tellson s door  who made off with it  was put to death  the coiner of a bad shilling was put to death  the sounders of three fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of crime  were put to death  not that it did the least good in the way of prevention  it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse  but  it cleared off  as to this world  the trouble of each particular case  and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after  thus  tellson s  in its day  like greater places of business  its contemporaries  had taken so many lives  that  if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on temple bar instead of being privately disposed of  they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had  in a rather significant manner   cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at tellson s  the oldest of men carried on the business gravely  when they took a young man into tellson s london house  they hid him somewhere till he was old  they kept him in a dark place  like a cheese  until he had the full tellson flavour and blue mould upon him  then only was he permitted to be seen  spectacularly poring over large books  and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment   outside tellson s  never by any means in it  unless called in  was an odd job man  an occasional porter and messenger  who served as the live sign of the house  he was never absent during business hours  unless upon an errand  and then he was represented by his son  a grisly urchin of twelve  who was his express image  people understood that tellson s  in a stately way  tolerated the odd job man  the house had always tolerated some person in that capacity  and time and tide had drifted this person to the post  his surname was cruncher  and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness  in the easterly parish church of hounsditch  he had received the added appellation of jerry   the scene was mr  cruncher s private lodging in hanging sword alley  whitefriars  the time  half past seven of the clock on a windy march morning  anno domini seventeen hundred and eighty   mr  cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our lord as anna dominoes  apparently under the impression that the christian era dated from the invention of a popular game  by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it    mr  cruncher s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood  and were but two in number  even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one  but they were very decently kept  early as it was  on the windy march morning  the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout  and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast  and the lumbering deal table  a very clean white cloth was spread   mr  cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane  like a harlequin at home  at first  he slept heavily  but  by degrees  began to roll and surge in bed  until he rose above the surface  with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons  at which juncture  he exclaimed  in a voice of dire exasperation    bust me  if she ain t at it agin    a woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner  with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to    what   said mr  cruncher  looking out of bed for a boot   you re at it agin  are you    after hailing the morn with this second salutation  he threw a boot at the woman as a third  it was a very muddy boot  and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with mr  cruncher s domestic economy  that  whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots  he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay    what   said mr  cruncher  varying his apostrophe after missing his mark   what are you up to  aggerawayter     i was only saying my prayers     saying your prayers  you re a nice woman  what do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me     i was not praying against you  i was praying for you     you weren t  and if you were  i won t be took the liberty with  here  your mother s a nice woman  young jerry  going a praying agin your father s prosperity  you ve got a dutiful mother  you have  my son  you ve got a religious mother  you have  my boy  going and flopping herself down  and praying that the bread and butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child    master cruncher  who was in his shirt  took this very ill  and  turning to his mother  strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board    and what do you suppose  you conceited female   said mr  cruncher  with unconscious inconsistency   that the worth of your prayers may be  name the price that you put your prayers at     they only come from the heart  jerry  they are worth no more than that     worth no more than that   repeated mr  cruncher   they ain t worth much  then  whether or no  i won t be prayed agin  i tell you  i can t afford it  i m not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking  if you must go flopping yourself down  flop in favour of your husband and child  and not in opposition to  em  if i had had any but a unnat ral wife  and this poor boy had had any but a unnat ral mother  i might have made some money last week instead of being counter prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck  b u u ust me   said mr  cruncher  who all this time had been putting on his clothes   if i ain t  what with piety and one blowed thing and another  been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with  young jerry  dress yourself  my boy  and while i clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then  and if you see any signs of more flopping  give me a call  for  i tell you   here he addressed his wife once more   i won t be gone agin  in this manner  i am as rickety as a hackney coach  i m as sleepy as laudanum  my lines is strained to that degree that i shouldn t know  if it wasn t for the pain in  em  which was me and which somebody else  yet i m none the better for it in pocket  and it s my suspicion that you ve been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket  and i won t put up with it  aggerawayter  and what do you say now    growling  in addition  such phrases as  ah  yes  you re religious  too  you wouldn t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child  would you  not you   and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation  mr  cruncher betook himself to his boot cleaning and his general preparation for business  in the meantime  his son  whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes  and whose young eyes stood close by one another  as his father s did  kept the required watch upon his mother  he greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals  by darting out of his sleeping closet  where he made his toilet  with a suppressed cry of  you are going to flop  mother    halloa  father   and  after raising this fictitious alarm  darting in again with an undutiful grin   mr  cruncher s temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast  he resented mrs  cruncher s saying grace with particular animosity    now  aggerawayter  what are you up to  at it again    his wife explained that she had merely  asked a blessing     don t do it   said mr  crunches looking about  as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife s petitions   i ain t a going to be blest out of house and home  i won t have my wittles blest off my table  keep still    exceedingly red eyed and grim  as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn  jerry cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it  growling over it like any four footed inmate of a menagerie  towards nine o clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect  and  presenting as respectable and business like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with  issued forth to the occupation of the day   it could scarcely be called a trade  in spite of his favourite description of himself as  a honest tradesman   his stock consisted of a wooden stool  made out of a broken backed chair cut down  which stool  young jerry  walking at his father s side  carried every morning to beneath the banking house window that was nearest temple bar  where  with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd job man s feet  it formed the encampment for the day  on this post of his  mr  cruncher was as well known to fleet street and the temple  as the bar itself   and was almost as in looking   encamped at a quarter before nine  in good time to touch his three cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to tellson s  jerry took up his station on this windy march morning  with young jerry standing by him  when not engaged in making forays through the bar  to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose  father and son  extremely like each other  looking silently on at the morning traffic in fleet street  with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were  bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys  the resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance  that the mature jerry bit and spat out straw  while the twinkling eyes of the youthful jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in fleet street   the head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to tellson s establishment was put through the door  and the word was given    porter wanted     hooray  father  here s an early job to begin with    having thus given his parent god speed  young jerry seated himself on the stool  entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing  and cogitated    al ways rusty  his fingers is al ways rusty   muttered young jerry   where does my father get all that iron rust from  he don t get no iron rust here       ii  a sight    you know the old bailey well  no doubt   said one of the oldest of clerks to jerry the messenger    ye es  sir   returned jerry  in something of a dogged manner   i do know the bailey     just so  and you know mr  lorry     i know mr  lorry  sir  much better than i know the bailey  much better   said jerry  not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question   than i  as a honest tradesman  wish to know the bailey     very well  find the door where the witnesses go in  and show the door keeper this note for mr  lorry  he will then let you in     into the court  sir     into the court    mr  cruncher s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another  and to interchange the inquiry   what do you think of this     am i to wait in the court  sir   he asked  as the result of that conference    i am going to tell you  the door keeper will pass the note to mr  lorry  and do you make any gesture that will attract mr  lorry s attention  and show him where you stand  then what you have to do  is  to remain there until he wants you     is that all  sir     that s all  he wishes to have a messenger at hand  this is to tell him you are there    as the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note  mr  cruncher  after surveying him in silence until he came to the blotting paper stage  remarked    i suppose they ll be trying forgeries this morning     treason     that s quartering   said jerry   barbarous     it is the law   remarked the ancient clerk  turning his surprised spectacles upon him   it is the law     it s hard in the law to spile a man  i think  it s hard enough to kill him  but it s wery hard to spile him  sir     not at all   retained the ancient clerk   speak well of the law  take care of your chest and voice  my good friend  and leave the law to take care of itself  i give you that advice     it s the damp  sir  what settles on my chest and voice   said jerry   i leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is     well  well   said the old clerk   we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood  some of us have damp ways  and some of us have dry ways  here is the letter  go along    jerry took the letter  and  remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of   you are a lean old one  too   made his bow  informed his son  in passing  of his destination  and went his way   they hanged at tyburn  in those days  so the street outside newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it  but  the gaol was a vile place  in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised  and where dire diseases were bred  that came into court with the prisoners  and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my lord chief justice himself  and pulled him off the bench  it had more than once happened  that the judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner s  and even died before him  for the rest  the old bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn yard  from which pale travellers set out continually  in carts and coaches  on a violent passage into the other world  traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road  and shaming few good citizens  if any  so powerful is use  and so desirable to be good use in the beginning  it was famous  too  for the pillory  a wise old institution  that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent  also  for the whipping post  another dear old institution  very humanising and softening to behold in action  also  for extensive transactions in blood money  another fragment of ancestral wisdom  systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under heaven  altogether  the old bailey  at that date  was a choice illustration of the precept  that  whatever is is right   an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy  did it not include the troublesome consequence  that nothing that ever was  was wrong   making his way through the tainted crowd  dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action  with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly  the messenger found out the door he sought  and handed in his letter through a trap in it  for  people then paid to see the play at the old bailey  just as they paid to see the play in bedlam  only the former entertainment was much the dearer  therefore  all the old bailey doors were well guarded  except  indeed  the social doors by which the criminals got there  and those were always left wide open   after some delay and demur  the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way  and allowed mr  jerry cruncher to squeeze himself into court    what s on   he asked  in a whisper  of the man he found himself next to    nothing yet     what s coming on     the treason case     the quartering one  eh     ah   returned the man  with a relish   he ll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged  and then he ll be taken down and sliced before his own face  and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on  and then his head will be chopped off  and he ll be cut into quarters  that s the sentence     if he s found guilty  you mean to say   jerry added  by way of proviso    oh  they ll find him guilty   said the other   don t you be afraid of that    mr  cruncher s attention was here diverted to the door keeper  whom he saw making his way to mr  lorry  with the note in his hand  mr  lorry sat at a table  among the gentlemen in wigs  not far from a wigged gentleman  the prisoner s counsel  who had a great bundle of papers before him  and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets  whose whole attention  when mr  cruncher looked at him then or afterwards  seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court  after some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand  jerry attracted the notice of mr  lorry  who had stood up to look for him  and who quietly nodded and sat down again    what s he got to do with the case   asked the man he had spoken with    blest if i know   said jerry    what have you got to do with it  then  if a person may inquire     blest if i know that either   said jerry   the entrance of the judge  and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court  stopped the dialogue  presently  the dock became the central point of interest  two gaolers  who had been standing there  went out  and the prisoner was brought in  and put to the bar   everybody present  except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling  stared at him  all the human breath in the place  rolled at him  like a sea  or a wind  or a fire  eager faces strained round pillars and corners  to get a sight of him  spectators in back rows stood up  not to miss a hair of him  people on the floor of the court  laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them  to help themselves  at anybody s cost  to a view of him  stood a tiptoe  got upon ledges  stood upon next to nothing  to see every inch of him  conspicuous among these latter  like an animated bit of the spiked wall of newgate  jerry stood  aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along  and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer  and gin  and tea  and coffee  and what not  that flowed at him  and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain   the object of all this staring and blaring  was a young man of about five and twenty  well grown and well looking  with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye  his condition was that of a young gentleman  he was plainly dressed in black  or very dark grey  and his hair  which was long and dark  was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck  more to be out of his way than for ornament  as an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body  so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek  showing the soul to be stronger than the sun  he was otherwise quite self possessed  bowed to the judge  and stood quiet   the sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at  was not a sort that elevated humanity  had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentence  had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being spared  by just so much would he have lost in his fascination  the form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled  was the sight  the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder  yielded the sensation  whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest  according to their several arts and powers of self deceit  the interest was  at the root of it  ogreish   silence in the court  charles darnay had yesterday pleaded not guilty to an indictment denouncing him  with infinite jingle and jangle  for that he was a false traitor to our serene  illustrious  excellent  and so forth  prince  our lord the king  by reason of his having  on divers occasions  and by divers means and ways  assisted lewis  the french king  in his wars against our said serene  illustrious  excellent  and so forth  that was to say  by coming and going  between the dominions of our said serene  illustrious  excellent  and so forth  and those of the said french lewis  and wickedly  falsely  traitorously  and otherwise evil adverbiously  revealing to the said french lewis what forces our said serene  illustrious  excellent  and so forth  had in preparation to send to canada and north america  this much  jerry  with his head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it  made out with huge satisfaction  and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid  and over and over again aforesaid  charles darnay  stood there before him upon his trial  that the jury were swearing in  and that mr  attorney general was making ready to speak   the accused  who was  and who knew he was  being mentally hanged  beheaded  and quartered  by everybody there  neither flinched from the situation  nor assumed any theatrical air in it  he was quiet and attentive  watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest  and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him  so composedly  that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn  the court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar  as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever   over the prisoner s head there was a mirror  to throw the light down upon him  crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it  and had passed from its surface and this earth s together  haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been  if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections  as the ocean is one day to give up its dead  some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved  may have struck the prisoner s mind  be that as it may  a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face  he looked up  and when he saw the glass his face flushed  and his right hand pushed the herbs away   it happened  that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left  about on a level with his eyes  there sat  in that corner of the judge s bench  two persons upon whom his look immediately rested  so immediately  and so much to the changing of his aspect  that all the eyes that were turned upon him  turned to them   the spectators saw in the two figures  a young lady of little more than twenty  and a gentleman who was evidently her father  a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair  and a certain indescribable intensity of face  not of an active kind  but pondering and self communing  when this expression was upon him  he looked as if he were old  but when it was stirred and broken up  as it was now  in a moment  on his speaking to his daughter  he became a handsome man  not past the prime of life   his daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm  as she sat by him  and the other pressed upon it  she had drawn close to him  in her dread of the scene  and in her pity for the prisoner  her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused  this had been so very noticeable  so very powerfully and naturally shown  that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her  and the whisper went about   who are they    jerry  the messenger  who had made his own observations  in his own manner  and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption  stretched his neck to hear who they were  the crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant  and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back  at last it got to jerry    witnesses     for which side     against     against what side     the prisoner s    the judge  whose eyes had gone in the general direction  recalled them  leaned back in his seat  and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand  as mr  attorney general rose to spin the rope  grind the axe  and hammer the nails into the scaffold      iii  a disappointment   mr  attorney general had to inform the jury  that the prisoner before them  though young in years  was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life  that this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to day  or of yesterday  or even of last year  or of the year before  that  it was certain the prisoner had  for longer than that  been in the habit of passing and repassing between france and england  on secret business of which he could give no honest account  that  if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive  which happily it never was   the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered  that providence  however  had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach  to ferret out the nature of the prisoner s schemes  and  struck with horror  to disclose them to his majesty s chief secretary of state and most honourable privy council  that  this patriot would be produced before them  that  his position and attitude were  on the whole  sublime  that  he had been the prisoner s friend  but  at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy  had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom  on the sacred altar of his country  that  if statues were decreed in britain  as in ancient greece and rome  to public benefactors  this shining citizen would assuredly have had one  that  as they were not so decreed  he probably would not have one  that  virtue  as had been observed by the poets  in many passages which he well knew the jury would have  word for word  at the tips of their tongues  whereat the jury s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages   was in a manner contagious  more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism  or love of country  that  the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the crown  to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour  had communicated itself to the prisoner s servant  and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his master s table drawers and pockets  and secrete his papers  that  he  mr  attorney general  was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant  but that  in a general way  he preferred him to his  mr  attorney general s  brothers and sisters  and honoured him more than his  mr  attorney general s  father and mother  that  he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise  that  the evidence of these two witnesses  coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced  would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his majesty s forces  and of their disposition and preparation  both by sea and land  and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power  that  these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner s handwriting  but that it was all the same  that  indeed  it was rather the better for the prosecution  as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions  that  the proof would go back five years  and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions  within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the british troops and the americans  that  for these reasons  the jury  being a loyal jury  as he knew they were   and being a responsible jury  as they knew they were   must positively find the prisoner guilty  and make an end of him  whether they liked it or not  that  they never could lay their heads upon their pillows  that  they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows  that  they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows  in short  that there never more could be  for them or theirs  any laying of heads upon pillows at all  unless the prisoner s head was taken off  that head mr  attorney general concluded by demanding of them  in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it  and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone   when the attorney general ceased  a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue flies were swarming about the prisoner  in anticipation of what he was soon to become  when toned down again  the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness box   mr  solicitor general then  following his leader s lead  examined the patriot  john barsad  gentleman  by name  the story of his pure soul was exactly what mr  attorney general had described it to be  perhaps  if it had a fault  a little too exactly  having released his noble bosom of its burden  he would have modestly withdrawn himself  but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him  sitting not far from mr  lorry  begged to ask him a few questions  the wigged gentleman sitting opposite  still looking at the ceiling of the court   had he ever been a spy himself  no  he scorned the base insinuation  what did he live upon  his property  where was his property  he didn t precisely remember where it was  what was it  no business of anybody s  had he inherited it  yes  he had  from whom  distant relation  very distant  rather  ever been in prison  certainly not  never in a debtors  prison  didn t see what that had to do with it  never in a debtors  prison   come  once again  never  yes  how many times  two or three times  not five or six  perhaps  of what profession  gentleman  ever been kicked  might have been  frequently  no  ever kicked downstairs  decidedly not  once received a kick on the top of a staircase  and fell downstairs of his own accord  kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice  something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault  but it was not true  swear it was not true  positively  ever live by cheating at play  never  ever live by play  not more than other gentlemen do  ever borrow money of the prisoner  yes  ever pay him  no  was not this intimacy with the prisoner  in reality a very slight one  forced upon the prisoner in coaches  inns  and packets  no  sure he saw the prisoner with these lists  certain  knew no more about the lists  no  had not procured them himself  for instance  no  expect to get anything by this evidence  no  not in regular government pay and employment  to lay traps  oh dear no  or to do anything  oh dear no  swear that  over and over again  no motives but motives of sheer patriotism  none whatever   the virtuous servant  roger cly  swore his way through the case at a great rate  he had taken service with the prisoner  in good faith and simplicity  four years ago  he had asked the prisoner  aboard the calais packet  if he wanted a handy fellow  and the prisoner had engaged him  he had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity  never thought of such a thing  he began to have suspicions of the prisoner  and to keep an eye upon him  soon afterwards  in arranging his clothes  while travelling  he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner s pockets  over and over again  he had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner s desk  he had not put them there first  he had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to french gentlemen at calais  and similar lists to french gentlemen  both at calais and boulogne  he loved his country  and couldn t bear it  and had given information  he had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea pot  he had been maligned respecting a mustard pot  but it turned out to be only a plated one  he had known the last witness seven or eight years  that was merely a coincidence  he didn t call it a particularly curious coincidence  most coincidences were curious  neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too  he was a true briton  and hoped there were many like him   the blue flies buzzed again  and mr  attorney general called mr  jarvis lorry    mr  jarvis lorry  are you a clerk in tellson s bank     i am     on a certain friday night in november one thousand seven hundred and seventy five  did business occasion you to travel between london and dover by the mail     it did     were there any other passengers in the mail     two     did they alight on the road in the course of the night     they did     mr  lorry  look upon the prisoner  was he one of those two passengers     i cannot undertake to say that he was     does he resemble either of these two passengers     both were so wrapped up  and the night was so dark  and we were all so reserved  that i cannot undertake to say even that     mr  lorry  look again upon the prisoner  supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were  is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them     no     you will not swear  mr  lorry  that he was not one of them     no     so at least you say he may have been one of them     yes  except that i remember them both to have been  like myself  timorous of highwaymen  and the prisoner has not a timorous air     did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity  mr  lorry     i certainly have seen that     mr  lorry  look once more upon the prisoner  have you seen him  to your certain knowledge  before     i have     when     i was returning from france a few days afterwards  and  at calais  the prisoner came on board the packet ship in which i returned  and made the voyage with me     at what hour did he come on board     at a little after midnight     in the dead of the night  was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour     he happened to be the only one     never mind about  happening   mr  lorry  he was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night     he was     were you travelling alone  mr  lorry  or with any companion     with two companions  a gentleman and lady  they are here     they are here  had you any conversation with the prisoner     hardly any  the weather was stormy  and the passage long and rough  and i lay on a sofa  almost from shore to shore     miss manette    the young lady  to whom all eyes had been turned before  and were now turned again  stood up where she had sat  her father rose with her  and kept her hand drawn through his arm    miss manette  look upon the prisoner    to be confronted with such pity  and such earnest youth and beauty  was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd  standing  as it were  apart with her on the edge of his grave  not all the staring curiosity that looked on  could  for the moment  nerve him to remain quite still  his hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden  and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart  the buzz of the great flies was loud again    miss manette  have you seen the prisoner before     yes  sir     where     on board of the packet ship just now referred to  sir  and on the same occasion     you are the young lady just now referred to     o  most unhappily  i am    the plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice of the judge  as he said something fiercely   answer the questions put to you  and make no remark upon them     miss manette  had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the channel     yes  sir     recall it    in the midst of a profound stillness  she faintly began   when the gentleman came on board      do you mean the prisoner   inquired the judge  knitting his brows    yes  my lord     then say the prisoner     when the prisoner came on board  he noticed that my father   turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her   was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health  my father was so reduced that i was afraid to take him out of the air  and i had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps  and i sat on the deck at his side to take care of him  there were no other passengers that night  but we four  the prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how i could shelter my father from the wind and weather  better than i had done  i had not known how to do it well  not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour  he did it for me  he expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father s state  and i am sure he felt it  that was the manner of our beginning to speak together     let me interrupt you for a moment  had he come on board alone     no     how many were with him     two french gentlemen     had they conferred together     they had conferred together until the last moment  when it was necessary for the french gentlemen to be landed in their boat     had any papers been handed about among them  similar to these lists     some papers had been handed about among them  but i don t know what papers     like these in shape and size     possibly  but indeed i don t know  although they stood whispering very near to me  because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there  it was a dull lamp  and they spoke very low  and i did not hear what they said  and saw only that they looked at papers     now  to the prisoner s conversation  miss manette     the prisoner was as open in his confidence with me  which arose out of my helpless situation  as he was kind  and good  and useful to my father  i hope   bursting into tears   i may not repay him by doing him harm to day    buzzing from the blue flies    miss manette  if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to give  which you must give  and which you cannot escape from giving  with great unwillingness  he is the only person present in that condition  please to go on     he told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature  which might get people into trouble  and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name  he said that this business had  within a few days  taken him to france  and might  at intervals  take him backwards and forwards between france and england for a long time to come     did he say anything about america  miss manette  be particular     he tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen  and he said that  so far as he could judge  it was a wrong and foolish one on england s part  he added  in a jesting way  that perhaps george washington might gain almost as great a name in history as george the third  but there was no harm in his way of saying this  it was said laughingly  and to beguile the time    any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed  will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators  her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence  and  in the pauses when she stopped for the judge to write it down  watched its effect upon the counsel for and against  among the lookers on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court  insomuch  that a great majority of the foreheads there  might have been mirrors reflecting the witness  when the judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about george washington   mr  attorney general now signified to my lord  that he deemed it necessary  as a matter of precaution and form  to call the young lady s father  doctor manette  who was called accordingly    doctor manette  look upon the prisoner  have you ever seen him before     once  when he called at my lodgings in london  some three years  or three years and a half ago     can you identify him as your fellow passenger on board the packet  or speak to his conversation with your daughter     sir  i can do neither     is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either    he answered  in a low voice   there is     has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment  without trial  or even accusation  in your native country  doctor manette    he answered  in a tone that went to every heart   a long imprisonment     were you newly released on the occasion in question     they tell me so     have you no remembrance of the occasion     none  my mind is a blank  from some time  i cannot even say what time  when i employed myself  in my captivity  in making shoes  to the time when i found myself living in london with my dear daughter here  she had become familiar to me  when a gracious god restored my faculties  but  i am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar  i have no remembrance of the process    mr  attorney general sat down  and the father and daughter sat down together   a singular circumstance then arose in the case  the object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down  with some fellow plotter untracked  in the dover mail on that friday night in november five years ago  and got out of the mail in the night  as a blind  at a place where he did not remain  but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more  to a garrison and dockyard  and there collected information  a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required  in the coffee room of an hotel in that garrison and dockyard town  waiting for another person  the prisoner s counsel was cross examining this witness with no result  except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion  when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court  wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper  screwed it up  and tossed it to him  opening this piece of paper in the next pause  the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner    you say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner    the witness was quite sure    did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner    not so like  the witness said  as that he could be mistaken    look well upon that gentleman  my learned friend there   pointing to him who had tossed the paper over   and then look well upon the prisoner  how say you  are they very like each other    allowing for my learned friend s appearance being careless and slovenly if not debauched  they were sufficiently like each other to surprise  not only the witness  but everybody present  when they were thus brought into comparison  my lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig  and giving no very gracious consent  the likeness became much more remarkable  my lord inquired of mr  stryver  the prisoner s counsel   whether they were next to try mr  carton  name of my learned friend  for treason  but  mr  stryver replied to my lord  no  but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once  might happen twice  whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner  whether he would be so confident  having seen it  and more  the upshot of which  was  to smash this witness like a crockery vessel  and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber   mr  cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence  he had now to attend while mr  stryver fitted the prisoner s case on the jury  like a compact suit of clothes  showing them how the patriot  barsad  was a hired spy and traitor  an unblushing trafficker in blood  and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed judas  which he certainly did look rather like  how the virtuous servant  cly  was his friend and partner  and was worthy to be  how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim  because some family affairs in france  he being of french extraction  did require his making those passages across the channel  though what those affairs were  a consideration for others who were near and dear to him  forbade him  even for his life  to disclose  how the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady  whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed  came to nothing  involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together   with the exception of that reference to george washington  which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke  how it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears  and therefore mr  attorney general had made the most of it  how  nevertheless  it rested upon nothing  save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases  and of which the state trials of this country were full  but  there my lord interposed  with as grave a face as if it had not been true   saying that he could not sit upon that bench and suffer those allusions   mr  stryver then called his few witnesses  and mr  cruncher had next to attend while mr  attorney general turned the whole suit of clothes mr  stryver had fitted on the jury  inside out  showing how barsad and cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them  and the prisoner a hundred times worse  lastly  came my lord himself  turning the suit of clothes  now inside out  now outside in  but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave clothes for the prisoner   and now  the jury turned to consider  and the great flies swarmed again   mr  carton  who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court  changed neither his place nor his attitude  even in this excitement  while his learned friend  mr  stryver  massing his papers before him  whispered with those who sat near  and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury  while all the spectators moved more or less  and grouped themselves anew  while even my lord himself arose from his seat  and slowly paced up and down his platform  not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish  this one man sat leaning back  with his torn gown half off him  his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal  his hands in his pockets  and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day  something especially reckless in his demeanour  not only gave him a disreputable look  but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner  which his momentary earnestness  when they were compared together  had strengthened   that many of the lookers on  taking note of him now  said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike  mr  cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour  and added   i d hold half a guinea that he don t get no law work to do  don t look like the sort of one to get any  do he    yet  this mr  carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in  for now  when miss manette s head dropped upon her father s breast  he was the first to see it  and to say audibly   officer  look to that young lady  help the gentleman to take her out  don t you see she will fall    there was much commiseration for her as she was removed  and much sympathy with her father  it had evidently been a great distress to him  to have the days of his imprisonment recalled  he had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned  and that pondering or brooding look which made him old  had been upon him  like a heavy cloud  ever since  as he passed out  the jury  who had turned back and paused a moment  spoke  through their foreman   they were not agreed  and wished to retire  my lord  perhaps with george washington on his mind  showed some surprise that they were not agreed  but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward  and retired himself  the trial had lasted all day  and the lamps in the court were now being lighted  it began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while  the spectators dropped off to get refreshment  and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock  and sat down   mr  lorry  who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out  now reappeared  and beckoned to jerry  who  in the slackened interest  could easily get near him    jerry  if you wish to take something to eat  you can  but  keep in the way  you will be sure to hear when the jury come in  don t be a moment behind them  for i want you to take the verdict back to the bank  you are the quickest messenger i know  and will get to temple bar long before i can    jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle  and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling  mr  carton came up at the moment  and touched mr  lorry on the arm    how is the young lady     she is greatly distressed  but her father is comforting her  and she feels the better for being out of court     i ll tell the prisoner so  it won t do for a respectable bank gentleman like you  to be seen speaking to him publicly  you know    mr  lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind  and mr  carton made his way to the outside of the bar  the way out of court lay in that direction  and jerry followed him  all eyes  ears  and spikes    mr  darnay    the prisoner came forward directly    you will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness  miss manette  she will do very well  you have seen the worst of her agitation     i am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it  could you tell her so for me  with my fervent acknowledgments     yes  i could  i will  if you ask it    mr  carton s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent  he stood  half turned from the prisoner  lounging with his elbow against the bar    i do ask it  accept my cordial thanks     what   said carton  still only half turned towards him   do you expect  mr  darnay     the worst     it s the wisest thing to expect  and the likeliest  but i think their withdrawing is in your favour    loitering on the way out of court not being allowed  jerry heard no more  but left them  so like each other in feature  so unlike each other in manner  standing side by side  both reflected in the glass above them   an hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief and rascal crowded passages below  even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale  the hoarse messenger  uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection  had dropped into a doze  when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court  carried him along with them    jerry  jerry   mr  lorry was already calling at the door when he got there    here  sir  it s a fight to get back again  here i am  sir    mr  lorry handed him a paper through the throng   quick  have you got it     yes  sir    hastily written on the paper was the word  acquitted     if you had sent the message   recalled to life   again   muttered jerry  as he turned   i should have known what you meant  this time    he had no opportunity of saying  or so much as thinking  anything else  until he was clear of the old bailey  for  the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs  and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue flies were dispersing in search of other carrion      iv  congratulatory   from the dimly lighted passages of the court  the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day  was straining off  when doctor manette  lucie manette  his daughter  mr  lorry  the solicitor for the defence  and its counsel  mr  stryver  stood gathered round mr  charles darnay  just released  congratulating him on his escape from death   it would have been difficult by a far brighter light  to recognise in doctor manette  intellectual of face and upright of bearing  the shoemaker of the garret in paris  yet  no one could have looked at him twice  without looking again  even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice  and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully  without any apparent reason  while one external cause  and that a reference to his long lingering agony  would always  as on the trial  evoke this condition from the depths of his soul  it was also in its nature to arise of itself  and to draw a gloom over him  as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun  when the substance was three hundred miles away   only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind  she was the golden thread that united him to a past beyond his misery  and to a present beyond his misery  and the sound of her voice  the light of her face  the touch of her hand  had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always  not absolutely always  for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed  but they were few and slight  and she believed them over   mr  darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully  and had turned to mr  stryver  whom he warmly thanked  mr  stryver  a man of little more than thirty  but looking twenty years older than he was  stout  loud  red  bluff  and free from any drawback of delicacy  had a pushing way of shouldering himself  morally and physically  into companies and conversations  that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life   he still had his wig and gown on  and he said  squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent mr  lorry clean out of the group   i am glad to have brought you off with honour  mr  darnay  it was an infamous prosecution  grossly infamous  but not the less likely to succeed on that account     you have laid me under an obligation to you for life  in two senses    said his late client  taking his hand    i have done my best for you  mr  darnay  and my best is as good as another man s  i believe    it clearly being incumbent on some one to say   much better   mr  lorry said it  perhaps not quite disinterestedly  but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again    you think so   said mr  stryver   well  you have been present all day  and you ought to know  you are a man of business  too     and as such   quoth mr  lorry  whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group  just as he had previously shouldered him out of it   as such i will appeal to doctor manette  to break up this conference and order us all to our homes  miss lucie looks ill  mr  darnay has had a terrible day  we are worn out     speak for yourself  mr  lorry   said stryver   i have a night s work to do yet  speak for yourself     i speak for myself   answered mr  lorry   and for mr  darnay  and for miss lucie  and  miss lucie  do you not think i may speak for us all    he asked her the question pointedly  and with a glance at her father   his face had become frozen  as it were  in a very curious look at darnay  an intent look  deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust  not even unmixed with fear  with this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away    my father   said lucie  softly laying her hand on his   he slowly shook the shadow off  and turned to her    shall we go home  my father    with a long breath  he answered  yes    the friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed  under the impression  which he himself had originated  that he would not be released that night  the lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages  the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle  and the dismal place was deserted until to morrow morning s interest of gallows  pillory  whipping post  and branding iron  should repeople it  walking between her father and mr  darnay  lucie manette passed into the open air  a hackney coach was called  and the father and daughter departed in it   mr  stryver had left them in the passages  to shoulder his way back to the robing room  another person  who had not joined the group  or interchanged a word with any one of them  but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest  had silently strolled out after the rest  and had looked on until the coach drove away  he now stepped up to where mr  lorry and mr  darnay stood upon the pavement    so  mr  lorry  men of business may speak to mr  darnay now    nobody had made any acknowledgment of mr  carton s part in the day s proceedings  nobody had known of it  he was unrobed  and was none the better for it in appearance    if you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind  when the business mind is divided between good natured impulse and business appearances  you would be amused  mr  darnay    mr  lorry reddened  and said  warmly   you have mentioned that before  sir  we men of business  who serve a house  are not our own masters  we have to think of the house more than ourselves     i know  i know   rejoined mr  carton  carelessly   don t be nettled  mr  lorry  you are as good as another  i have no doubt  better  i dare say     and indeed  sir   pursued mr  lorry  not minding him   i really don t know what you have to do with the matter  if you ll excuse me  as very much your elder  for saying so  i really don t know that it is your business     business  bless you  i have no business   said mr  carton    it is a pity you have not  sir     i think so  too     if you had   pursued mr  lorry   perhaps you would attend to it     lord love you  no   i shouldn t   said mr  carton    well  sir   cried mr  lorry  thoroughly heated by his indifference   business is a very good thing  and a very respectable thing  and  sir  if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments  mr  darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance  mr  darnay  good night  god bless you  sir  i hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life   chair there    perhaps a little angry with himself  as well as with the barrister  mr  lorry bustled into the chair  and was carried off to tellson s  carton  who smelt of port wine  and did not appear to be quite sober  laughed then  and turned to darnay    this is a strange chance that throws you and me together  this must be a strange night to you  standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones     i hardly seem yet   returned charles darnay   to belong to this world again     i don t wonder at it  it s not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another  you speak faintly     i begin to think i am faint     then why the devil don t you dine  i dined  myself  while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to  this  or some other  let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at    drawing his arm through his own  he took him down ludgate hill to fleet street  and so  up a covered way  into a tavern  here  they were shown into a little room  where charles darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine  while carton sat opposite to him at the same table  with his separate bottle of port before him  and his fully half insolent manner upon him    do you feel  yet  that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again  mr  darnay     i am frightfully confused regarding time and place  but i am so far mended as to feel that     it must be an immense satisfaction    he said it bitterly  and filled up his glass again  which was a large one    as to me  the greatest desire i have  is to forget that i belong to it  it has no good in it for me  except wine like this  nor i for it  so we are not much alike in that particular  indeed  i begin to think we are not much alike in any particular  you and i    confused by the emotion of the day  and feeling his being there with this double of coarse deportment  to be like a dream  charles darnay was at a loss how to answer  finally  answered not at all    now your dinner is done   carton presently said   why don t you call a health  mr  darnay  why don t you give your toast     what health  what toast     why  it s on the tip of your tongue  it ought to be  it must be  i ll swear it s there     miss manette  then     miss manette  then    looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast  carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall  where it shivered to pieces  then  rang the bell  and ordered in another    that s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark  mr  darnay    he said  filling his new goblet   a slight frown and a laconic  yes   were the answer    that s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by  how does it feel  is it worth being tried for one s life  to be the object of such sympathy and compassion  mr  darnay    again darnay answered not a word    she was mightily pleased to have your message  when i gave it her  not that she showed she was pleased  but i suppose she was    the allusion served as a timely reminder to darnay that this disagreeable companion had  of his own free will  assisted him in the strait of the day  he turned the dialogue to that point  and thanked him for it    i neither want any thanks  nor merit any   was the careless rejoinder   it was nothing to do  in the first place  and i don t know why i did it  in the second  mr  darnay  let me ask you a question     willingly  and a small return for your good offices     do you think i particularly like you     really  mr  carton   returned the other  oddly disconcerted   i have not asked myself the question     but ask yourself the question now     you have acted as if you do  but i don t think you do     i don t think i do   said carton   i begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding     nevertheless   pursued darnay  rising to ring the bell   there is nothing in that  i hope  to prevent my calling the reckoning  and our parting without ill blood on either side    carton rejoining   nothing in life   darnay rang   do you call the whole reckoning   said carton  on his answering in the affirmative   then bring me another pint of this same wine  drawer  and come and wake me at ten    the bill being paid  charles darnay rose and wished him good night  without returning the wish  carton rose too  with something of a threat of defiance in his manner  and said   a last word  mr  darnay  you think i am drunk     i think you have been drinking  mr  carton     think  you know i have been drinking     since i must say so  i know it     then you shall likewise know why  i am a disappointed drudge  sir  i care for no man on earth  and no man on earth cares for me     much to be regretted  you might have used your talents better     may be so  mr  darnay  may be not  don t let your sober face elate you  however  you don t know what it may come to  good night    when he was left alone  this strange being took up a candle  went to a glass that hung against the wall  and surveyed himself minutely in it    do you particularly like the man   he muttered  at his own image   why should you particularly like a man who resembles you  there is nothing in you to like  you know that  ah  confound you  what a change you have made in yourself  a good reason for taking to a man  that he shows you what you have fallen away from  and what you might have been  change places with him  and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was  and commiserated by that agitated face as he was  come on  and have it out in plain words  you hate the fellow    he resorted to his pint of wine for consolation  drank it all in a few minutes  and fell asleep on his arms  with his hair straggling over the table  and a long winding sheet in the candle dripping down upon him      v  the jackal   those were drinking days  and most men drank hard  so very great is the improvement time has brought about in such habits  that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night  without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman  would seem  in these days  a ridiculous exaggeration  the learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its bacchanalian propensities  neither was mr  stryver  already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice  behind his compeers in this particular  any more than in the drier parts of the legal race   a favourite at the old bailey  and eke at the sessions  mr  stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted  sessions and old bailey had now to summon their favourite  specially  to their longing arms  and shouldering itself towards the visage of the lord chief justice in the court of king s bench  the florid countenance of mr  stryver might be daily seen  bursting out of the bed of wigs  like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden full of flaring companions   it had once been noted at the bar  that while mr  stryver was a glib man  and an unscrupulous  and a ready  and a bold  he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements  which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate s accomplishments  but  a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this  the more business he got  the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow  and however late at night he sat carousing with sydney carton  he always had his points at his fingers  ends in the morning   sydney carton  idlest and most unpromising of men  was stryver s great ally  what the two drank together  between hilary term and michaelmas  might have floated a king s ship  stryver never had a case in hand  anywhere  but carton was there  with his hands in his pockets  staring at the ceiling of the court  they went the same circuit  and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night  and carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day  going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings  like a dissipated cat  at last  it began to get about  among such as were interested in the matter  that although sydney carton would never be a lion  he was an amazingly good jackal  and that he rendered suit and service to stryver in that humble capacity    ten o clock  sir   said the man at the tavern  whom he had charged to wake him   ten o clock  sir     what s the matter     ten o clock  sir     what do you mean  ten o clock at night     yes  sir  your honour told me to call you     oh  i remember  very well  very well    after a few dull efforts to get to sleep again  which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes  he got up  tossed his hat on  and walked out  he turned into the temple  and  having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of king s bench walk and paper buildings  turned into the stryver chambers   the stryver clerk  who never assisted at these conferences  had gone home  and the stryver principal opened the door  he had his slippers on  and a loose bed gown  and his throat was bare for his greater ease  he had that rather wild  strained  seared marking about the eyes  which may be observed in all free livers of his class  from the portrait of jeffries downward  and which can be traced  under various disguises of art  through the portraits of every drinking age    you are a little late  memory   said stryver    about the usual time  it may be a quarter of an hour later    they went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers  where there was a blazing fire  a kettle steamed upon the hob  and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone  with plenty of wine upon it  and brandy  and rum  and sugar  and lemons    you have had your bottle  i perceive  sydney     two to night  i think  i have been dining with the day s client  or seeing him dine  it s all one     that was a rare point  sydney  that you brought to bear upon the identification  how did you come by it  when did it strike you     i thought he was rather a handsome fellow  and i thought i should have been much the same sort of fellow  if i had had any luck    mr  stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch    you and your luck  sydney  get to work  get to work    sullenly enough  the jackal loosened his dress  went into an adjoining room  and came back with a large jug of cold water  a basin  and a towel or two  steeping the towels in the water  and partially wringing them out  he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold  sat down at the table  and said   now i am ready     not much boiling down to be done to night  memory   said mr  stryver  gaily  as he looked among his papers    how much     only two sets of them     give me the worst first     there they are  sydney  fire away    the lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinking table  while the jackal sat at his own paper bestrewn table proper  on the other side of it  with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand  both resorted to the drinking table without stint  but each in a different way  the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband  looking at the fire  or occasionally flirting with some lighter document  the jackal  with knitted brows and intent face  so deep in his task  that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass  which often groped about  for a minute or more  before it found the glass for his lips  two or three times  the matter in hand became so knotty  that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up  and steep his towels anew  from these pilgrimages to the jug and basin  he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe  which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity   at length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion  and proceeded to offer it to him  the lion took it with care and caution  made his selections from it  and his remarks upon it  and the jackal assisted both  when the repast was fully discussed  the lion put his hands in his waistband again  and lay down to meditate  the jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle  and a fresh application to his head  and applied himself to the collection of a second meal  this was administered to the lion in the same manner  and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning    and now we have done  sydney  fill a bumper of punch   said mr  stryver   the jackal removed the towels from his head  which had been steaming again  shook himself  yawned  shivered  and complied    you were very sound  sydney  in the matter of those crown witnesses to day  every question told     i always am sound  am i not     i don t gainsay it  what has roughened your temper  put some punch to it and smooth it again    with a deprecatory grunt  the jackal again complied    the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school   said stryver  nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past   the old seesaw sydney  up one minute and down the next  now in spirits and now in despondency     ah   returned the other  sighing   yes  the same sydney  with the same luck  even then  i did exercises for other boys  and seldom did my own     and why not     god knows  it was my way  i suppose    he sat  with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him  looking at the fire    carton   said his friend  squaring himself at him with a bullying air  as if the fire grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged  and the one delicate thing to be done for the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school was to shoulder him into it   your way is  and always was  a lame way  you summon no energy and purpose  look at me     oh  botheration   returned sydney  with a lighter and more good humoured laugh   don t you be moral     how have i done what i have done   said stryver   how do i do what i do     partly through paying me to help you  i suppose  but it s not worth your while to apostrophise me  or the air  about it  what you want to do  you do  you were always in the front rank  and i was always behind     i had to get into the front rank  i was not born there  was i     i was not present at the ceremony  but my opinion is you were   said carton  at this  he laughed again  and they both laughed    before shrewsbury  and at shrewsbury  and ever since shrewsbury    pursued carton   you have fallen into your rank  and i have fallen into mine  even when we were fellow students in the student quarter of paris  picking up french  and french law  and other french crumbs that we didn t get much good of  you were always somewhere  and i was always nowhere     and whose fault was that     upon my soul  i am not sure that it was not yours  you were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing  to that restless degree that i had no chance for my life but in rust and repose  it s a gloomy thing  however  to talk about one s own past  with the day breaking  turn me in some other direction before i go     well then  pledge me to the pretty witness   said stryver  holding up his glass   are you turned in a pleasant direction    apparently not  for he became gloomy again    pretty witness   he muttered  looking down into his glass   i have had enough of witnesses to day and to night  who s your pretty witness     the picturesque doctor s daughter  miss manette     she pretty     is she not     no     why  man alive  she was the admiration of the whole court     rot the admiration of the whole court  who made the old bailey a judge of beauty  she was a golden haired doll     do you know  sydney   said mr  stryver  looking at him with sharp eyes  and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face   do you know  i rather thought  at the time  that you sympathised with the golden haired doll  and were quick to see what happened to the golden haired doll     quick to see what happened  if a girl  doll or no doll  swoons within a yard or two of a man s nose  he can see it without a perspective glass  i pledge you  but i deny the beauty  and now i ll have no more drink  i ll get to bed    when his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle  to light him down the stairs  the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows  when he got out of the house  the air was cold and sad  the dull sky overcast  the river dark and dim  the whole scene like a lifeless desert  and wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast  as if the desert sand had risen far away  and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city   waste forces within him  and a desert all around  this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace  and saw for a moment  lying in the wilderness before him  a mirage of honourable ambition  self denial  and perseverance  in the fair city of this vision  there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him  gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening  waters of hope that sparkled in his sight  a moment  and it was gone  climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses  he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed  and its pillow was wet with wasted tears   sadly  sadly  the sun rose  it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions  incapable of their directed exercise  incapable of his own help and his own happiness  sensible of the blight on him  and resigning himself to let it eat him away      vi  hundreds of people   the quiet lodgings of doctor manette were in a quiet street corner not far from soho square  on the afternoon of a certain fine sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason  and carried it  as to the public interest and memory  far out to sea  mr  jarvis lorry walked along the sunny streets from clerkenwell where he lived  on his way to dine with the doctor  after several relapses into business absorption  mr  lorry had become the doctor s friend  and the quiet street corner was the sunny part of his life   on this certain fine sunday  mr  lorry walked towards soho  early in the afternoon  for three reasons of habit  firstly  because  on fine sundays  he often walked out  before dinner  with the doctor and lucie  secondly  because  on unfavourable sundays  he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend  talking  reading  looking out of window  and generally getting through the day  thirdly  because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve  and knew how the ways of the doctor s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them   a quainter corner than the corner where the doctor lived  was not to be found in london  there was no way through it  and the front windows of the doctor s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it  there were few buildings then  north of the oxford road  and forest trees flourished  and wild flowers grew  and the hawthorn blossomed  in the now vanished fields  as a consequence  country airs circulated in soho with vigorous freedom  instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement  and there was many a good south wall  not far off  on which the peaches ripened in their season   the summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day  but  when the streets grew hot  the corner was in shadow  though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness  it was a cool spot  staid but cheerful  a wonderful place for echoes  and a very harbour from the raging streets   there ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage  and there was  the doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house  where several callings purported to be pursued by day  but whereof little was audible any day  and which was shunned by all of them at night  in a building at the back  attainable by a courtyard where a plane tree rustled its green leaves  church organs claimed to be made  and silver to be chased  and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall  as if he had beaten himself precious  and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors  very little of these trades  or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up stairs  or of a dim coach trimming maker asserted to have a counting house below  was ever heard or seen  occasionally  a stray workman putting his coat on  traversed the hall  or a stranger peered about there  or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard  or a thump from the golden giant  these  however  were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane tree behind the house  and the echoes in the corner before it  had their own way from sunday morning unto saturday night   doctor manette received such patients here as his old reputation  and its revival in the floating whispers of his story  brought him  his scientific knowledge  and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments  brought him otherwise into moderate request  and he earned as much as he wanted   these things were within mr  jarvis lorry s knowledge  thoughts  and notice  when he rang the door bell of the tranquil house in the corner  on the fine sunday afternoon    doctor manette at home    expected home    miss lucie at home    expected home    miss pross at home    possibly at home  but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of miss pross  as to admission or denial of the fact    as i am at home myself   said mr  lorry   i ll go upstairs    although the doctor s daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth  she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means  which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics  simple as the furniture was  it was set off by so many little adornments  of no value but for their taste and fancy  that its effect was delightful  the disposition of everything in the rooms  from the largest object to the least  the arrangement of colours  the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles  by delicate hands  clear eyes  and good sense  were at once so pleasant in themselves  and so expressive of their originator  that  as mr  lorry stood looking about him  the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him  with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time  whether he approved   there were three rooms on a floor  and  the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all  mr  lorry  smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him  walked from one to another  the first was the best room  and in it were lucie s birds  and flowers  and books  and desk  and work table  and box of water colours  the second was the doctor s consulting room  used also as the dining room  the third  changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane tree in the yard  was the doctor s bedroom  and there  in a corner  stood the disused shoemaker s bench and tray of tools  much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wine shop  in the suburb of saint antoine in paris    i wonder   said mr  lorry  pausing in his looking about   that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him     and why wonder at that   was the abrupt inquiry that made him start   it proceeded from miss pross  the wild red woman  strong of hand  whose acquaintance he had first made at the royal george hotel at dover  and had since improved    i should have thought    mr  lorry began    pooh  you d have thought   said miss pross  and mr  lorry left off    how do you do   inquired that lady then  sharply  and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice    i am pretty well  i thank you   answered mr  lorry  with meekness   how are you     nothing to boast of   said miss pross    indeed     ah  indeed   said miss pross   i am very much put out about my ladybird     indeed     for gracious sake say something else besides  indeed   or you ll fidget me to death   said miss pross  whose character  dissociated from stature  was shortness    really  then   said mr  lorry  as an amendment    really  is bad enough   returned miss pross   but better  yes  i am very much put out     may i ask the cause     i don t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of ladybird  to come here looking after her   said miss pross    do dozens come for that purpose     hundreds   said miss pross   it was characteristic of this lady  as of some other people before her time and since  that whenever her original proposition was questioned  she exaggerated it    dear me   said mr  lorry  as the safest remark he could think of    i have lived with the darling  or the darling has lived with me  and paid me for it  which she certainly should never have done  you may take your affidavit  if i could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothing  since she was ten years old  and it s really very hard    said miss pross   not seeing with precision what was very hard  mr  lorry shook his head  using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything    all sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet  are always turning up   said miss pross   when you began it      i began it  miss pross     didn t you  who brought her father to life     oh  if that was beginning it    said mr  lorry    it wasn t ending it  i suppose  i say  when you began it  it was hard enough  not that i have any fault to find with doctor manette  except that he is not worthy of such a daughter  which is no imputation on him  for it was not to be expected that anybody should be  under any circumstances  but it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him  i could have forgiven him   to take ladybird s affections away from me    mr  lorry knew miss pross to be very jealous  but he also knew her by this time to be  beneath the service of her eccentricity  one of those unselfish creatures  found only among women  who will  for pure love and admiration  bind themselves willing slaves  to youth when they have lost it  to beauty that they never had  to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain  to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives  he knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart  so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint  he had such an exalted respect for it  that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind  we all make such arrangements  more or less  he stationed miss pross much nearer to the lower angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by nature and art  who had balances at tellson s    there never was  nor will be  but one man worthy of ladybird   said miss pross   and that was my brother solomon  if he hadn t made a mistake in life    here again  mr  lorry s inquiries into miss pross s personal history had established the fact that her brother solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed  as a stake to speculate with  and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore  with no touch of compunction  miss pross s fidelity of belief in solomon  deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake  was quite a serious matter with mr  lorry  and had its weight in his good opinion of her    as we happen to be alone for the moment  and are both people of business   he said  when they had got back to the drawing room and had sat down there in friendly relations   let me ask you  does the doctor  in talking with lucie  never refer to the shoemaking time  yet     never     and yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him     ah   returned miss pross  shaking her head   but i don t say he don t refer to it within himself     do you believe that he thinks of it much     i do   said miss pross    do you imagine    mr  lorry had begun  when miss pross took him up short with    never imagine anything  have no imagination at all     i stand corrected  do you suppose  you go so far as to suppose  sometimes     now and then   said miss pross    do you suppose   mr  lorry went on  with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye  as it looked kindly at her   that doctor manette has any theory of his own  preserved through all those years  relative to the cause of his being so oppressed  perhaps  even to the name of his oppressor     i don t suppose anything about it but what ladybird tells me     and that is       that she thinks he has     now don t be angry at my asking all these questions  because i am a mere dull man of business  and you are a woman of business     dull   miss pross inquired  with placidity   rather wishing his modest adjective away  mr  lorry replied   no  no  no  surely not  to return to business   is it not remarkable that doctor manette  unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is  should never touch upon that question  i will not say with me  though he had business relations with me many years ago  and we are now intimate  i will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached  and who is so devotedly attached to him  believe me  miss pross  i don t approach the topic with you  out of curiosity  but out of zealous interest     well  to the best of my understanding  and bad s the best  you ll tell me   said miss pross  softened by the tone of the apology   he is afraid of the whole subject     afraid     it s plain enough  i should think  why he may be  it s a dreadful remembrance  besides that  his loss of himself grew out of it  not knowing how he lost himself  or how he recovered himself  he may never feel certain of not losing himself again  that alone wouldn t make the subject pleasant  i should think    it was a profounder remark than mr  lorry had looked for   true   said he   and fearful to reflect upon  yet  a doubt lurks in my mind  miss pross  whether it is good for doctor manette to have that suppression always shut up within him  indeed  it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence     can t be helped   said miss pross  shaking her head   touch that string  and he instantly changes for the worse  better leave it alone  in short  must leave it alone  like or no like  sometimes  he gets up in the dead of the night  and will be heard  by us overhead there  walking up and down  walking up and down  in his room  ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down  walking up and down  in his old prison  she hurries to him  and they go on together  walking up and down  walking up and down  until he is composed  but he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness  to her  and she finds it best not to hint at it to him  in silence they go walking up and down together  walking up and down together  till her love and company have brought him to himself    notwithstanding miss pross s denial of her own imagination  there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea  in her repetition of the phrase  walking up and down  which testified to her possessing such a thing   the corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes  it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet  that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going    here they are   said miss pross  rising to break up the conference   and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon    it was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties  such a peculiar ear of a place  that as mr  lorry stood at the open window  looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard  he fancied they would never approach  not only would the echoes die away  as though the steps had gone  but  echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead  and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand  however  father and daughter did at last appear  and miss pross was ready at the street door to receive them   miss pross was a pleasant sight  albeit wild  and red  and grim  taking off her darling s bonnet when she came up stairs  and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief  and blowing the dust off it  and folding her mantle ready for laying by  and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women  her darling was a pleasant sight too  embracing her and thanking her  and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her  which last she only dared to do playfully  or miss pross  sorely hurt  would have retired to her own chamber and cried  the doctor was a pleasant sight too  looking on at them  and telling miss pross how she spoilt lucie  in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had  and would have had more if it were possible  mr  lorry was a pleasant sight too  beaming at all this in his little wig  and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home  but  no hundreds of people came to see the sights  and mr  lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of miss pross s prediction   dinner time  and still no hundreds of people  in the arrangements of the little household  miss pross took charge of the lower regions  and always acquitted herself marvellously  her dinners  of a very modest quality  were so well cooked and so well served  and so neat in their contrivances  half english and half french  that nothing could be better  miss pross s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind  she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces  in search of impoverished french  who  tempted by shillings and half crowns  would impart culinary mysteries to her  from these decayed sons and daughters of gaul  she had acquired such wonderful arts  that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress  or cinderella s godmother  who would send out for a fowl  a rabbit  a vegetable or two from the garden  and change them into anything she pleased   on sundays  miss pross dined at the doctor s table  but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods  either in the lower regions  or in her own room on the second floor  a blue chamber  to which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance  on this occasion  miss pross  responding to ladybird s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her  unbent exceedingly  so the dinner was very pleasant  too   it was an oppressive day  and  after dinner  lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane tree  and they should sit there in the air  as everything turned upon her  and revolved about her  they went out under the plane tree  and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of mr  lorry  she had installed herself  some time before  as mr  lorry s cup bearer  and while they sat under the plane tree  talking  she kept his glass replenished  mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked  and the plane tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads   still  the hundreds of people did not present themselves  mr  darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane tree  but he was only one   doctor manette received him kindly  and so did lucie  but  miss pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body  and retired into the house  she was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder  and she called it  in familiar conversation   a fit of the jerks    the doctor was in his best condition  and looked specially young  the resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times  and as they sat side by side  she leaning on his shoulder  and he resting his arm on the back of her chair  it was very agreeable to trace the likeness   he had been talking all day  on many subjects  and with unusual vivacity   pray  doctor manette   said mr  darnay  as they sat under the plane tree  and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand  which happened to be the old buildings of london   have you seen much of the tower     lucie and i have been there  but only casually  we have seen enough of it  to know that it teems with interest  little more     i have been there  as you remember   said darnay  with a smile  though reddening a little angrily   in another character  and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it  they told me a curious thing when i was there     what was that   lucie asked    in making some alterations  the workmen came upon an old dungeon  which had been  for many years  built up and forgotten  every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners  dates  names  complaints  and prayers  upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall  one prisoner  who seemed to have gone to execution  had cut as his last work  three letters  they were done with some very poor instrument  and hurriedly  with an unsteady hand  at first  they were read as d  i  c   but  on being more carefully examined  the last letter was found to be g  there was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials  and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been  at length  it was suggested that the letters were not initials  but the complete word  dig  the floor was examined very carefully under the inscription  and  in the earth beneath a stone  or tile  or some fragment of paving  were found the ashes of a paper  mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag  what the unknown prisoner had written will never be read  but he had written something  and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler     my father   exclaimed lucie   you are ill    he had suddenly started up  with his hand to his head  his manner and his look quite terrified them all    no  my dear  not ill  there are large drops of rain falling  and they made me start  we had better go in    he recovered himself almost instantly  rain was really falling in large drops  and he showed the back of his hand with rain drops on it  but  he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of  and  as they went into the house  the business eye of mr  lorry either detected  or fancied it detected  on his face  as it turned towards charles darnay  the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house   he recovered himself so quickly  however  that mr  lorry had doubts of his business eye  the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was  when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises  if he ever would be   and that the rain had startled him   tea time  and miss pross making tea  with another fit of the jerks upon her  and yet no hundreds of people  mr  carton had lounged in  but he made only two   the night was so very sultry  that although they sat with doors and windows open  they were overpowered by heat  when the tea table was done with  they all moved to one of the windows  and looked out into the heavy twilight  lucie sat by her father  darnay sat beside her  carton leaned against a window  the curtains were long and white  and some of the thunder gusts that whirled into the corner  caught them up to the ceiling  and waved them like spectral wings    the rain drops are still falling  large  heavy  and few   said doctor manette   it comes slowly     it comes surely   said carton   they spoke low  as people watching and waiting mostly do  as people in a dark room  watching and waiting for lightning  always do   there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke  the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going  yet not a footstep was there    a multitude of people  and yet a solitude   said darnay  when they had listened for a while    is it not impressive  mr  darnay   asked lucie   sometimes  i have sat here of an evening  until i have fancied  but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to night  when all is so black and solemn      let us shudder too  we may know what it is     it will seem nothing to you  such whims are only impressive as we originate them  i think  they are not to be communicated  i have sometimes sat alone here of an evening  listening  until i have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by and bye into our lives     there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives  if that be so    sydney carton struck in  in his moody way   the footsteps were incessant  and the hurry of them became more and more rapid  the corner echoed and re echoed with the tread of feet  some  as it seemed  under the windows  some  as it seemed  in the room  some coming  some going  some breaking off  some stopping altogether  all in the distant streets  and not one within sight    are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us  miss manette  or are we to divide them among us     i don t know  mr  darnay  i told you it was a foolish fancy  but you asked for it  when i have yielded myself to it  i have been alone  and then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life  and my father s     i take them into mine   said carton   i ask no questions and make no stipulations  there is a great crowd bearing down upon us  miss manette  and i see them  by the lightning   he added the last words  after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window    and i hear them   he added again  after a peal of thunder   here they come  fast  fierce  and furious    it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified  and it stopped him  for no voice could be heard in it  a memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water  and there was not a moment s interval in crash  and fire  and rain  until after the moon rose at midnight   the great bell of saint paul s was striking one in the cleared air  when mr  lorry  escorted by jerry  high booted and bearing a lantern  set forth on his return passage to clerkenwell  there were solitary patches of road on the way between soho and clerkenwell  and mr  lorry  mindful of foot pads  always retained jerry for this service  though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier    what a night it has been  almost a night  jerry   said mr  lorry   to bring the dead out of their graves     i never see the night myself  master  nor yet i don t expect to  what would do that   answered jerry    good night  mr  carton   said the man of business   good night  mr  darnay  shall we ever see such a night again  together    perhaps  perhaps  see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar  bearing down upon them  too      vii  monseigneur in town   monseigneur  one of the great lords in power at the court  held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in paris  monseigneur was in his inner room  his sanctuary of sanctuaries  the holiest of holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without  monseigneur was about to take his chocolate  monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease  and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing france  but  his morning s chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of monseigneur  without the aid of four strong men besides the cook   yes  it took four men  all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration  and the chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket  emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur  to conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneur s lips  one lacquey carried the chocolate pot into the sacred presence  a second  milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function  a third  presented the favoured napkin  a fourth  he of the two gold watches   poured the chocolate out  it was impossible for monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring heavens  deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men  he must have died of two   monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night  where the comedy and the grand opera were charmingly represented  monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights  with fascinating company  so polite and so impressible was monseigneur  that the comedy and the grand opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets  than the needs of all france  a happy circumstance for france  as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured   always was for england  by way of example   in the regretted days of the merry stuart who sold it   monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business  which was  to let everything go on in its own way  of particular public business  monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way  tend to his own power and pocket  of his pleasures  general and particular  monseigneur had the other truly noble idea  that the world was made for them  the text of his order  altered from the original by only a pronoun  which is not much  ran   the earth and the fulness thereof are mine  saith monseigneur    yet  monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs  both private and public  and he had  as to both classes of affairs  allied himself perforce with a farmer general  as to finances public  because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them  and must consequently let them out to somebody who could  as to finances private  because farmer generals were rich  and monseigneur  after generations of great luxury and expense  was growing poor  hence monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent  while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil  the cheapest garment she could wear  and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmer general  poor in family  which farmer general  carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it  was now among the company in the outer rooms  much prostrated before by mankind  always excepting superior mankind of the blood of monseigneur  who  his own wife included  looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt   a sumptuous man was the farmer general  thirty horses stood in his stables  twenty four male domestics sat in his halls  six body women waited on his wife  as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could  the farmer general  howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality  was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of monseigneur that day   for  the rooms  though a beautiful scene to look at  and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve  were  in truth  not a sound business  considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere  and not so far off  either  but that the watching towers of notre dame  almost equidistant from the two extremes  could see them both   they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business  if that could have been anybody s business  at the house of monseigneur  military officers destitute of military knowledge  naval officers with no idea of a ship  civil officers without a notion of affairs  brazen ecclesiastics  of the worst world worldly  with sensual eyes  loose tongues  and looser lives  all totally unfit for their several callings  all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them  but all nearly or remotely of the order of monseigneur  and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got  these were to be told off by the score and the score  people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state  yet equally unconnected with anything that was real  or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end  were no less abundant  doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed  smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante chambers of monseigneur  projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the state was touched  except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin  poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of  at the reception of monseigneur  unbelieving philosophers who were remodelling the world with words  and making card towers of babel to scale the skies with  talked with unbelieving chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals  at this wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur  exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding  which was at that remarkable time  and has been since  to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest  were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion  at the hotel of monseigneur  such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris  that the spies among the assembled devotees of monseigneur  forming a goodly half of the polite company  would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife  who  in her manners and appearance  owned to being a mother  indeed  except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world  which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother  there was no such thing known to the fashion  peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close  and brought them up  and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty   the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon monseigneur  in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had  for a few years  some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong  as a promising way of setting them right  half of the half dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of convulsionists  and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam  rage  roar  and turn cataleptic on the spot  thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger post to the future  for monseigneur s guidance  besides these dervishes  were other three who had rushed into another sect  which mended matters with a jargon about  the centre of truth   holding that man had got out of the centre of truth  which did not need much demonstration  but had not got out of the circumference  and that he was to be kept from flying out of the circumference  and was even to be shoved back into the centre  by fasting and seeing of spirits  among these  accordingly  much discoursing with spirits went on  and it did a world of good which never became manifest   but  the comfort was  that all the company at the grand hotel of monseigneur were perfectly dressed  if the day of judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day  everybody there would have been eternally correct  such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair  such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended  such gallant swords to look at  and such delicate honour to the sense of smell  would surely keep anything going  for ever and ever  the exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved  these golden fetters rang like precious little bells  and what with that ringing  and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen  there was a flutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and his devouring hunger far away   dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places  everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that was never to leave off  from the palace of the tuileries  through monseigneur and the whole court  through the chambers  the tribunals of justice  and all society  except the scarecrows   the fancy ball descended to the common executioner  who  in pursuance of the charm  was required to officiate  frizzled  powdered  in a gold laced coat  pumps  and white silk stockings   at the gallows and the wheel  the axe was a rarity  monsieur paris  as it was the episcopal mode among his brother professors of the provinces  monsieur orleans  and the rest  to call him  presided in this dainty dress  and who among the company at monseigneur s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our lord  could possibly doubt  that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman  powdered  gold laced  pumped  and white silk stockinged  would see the very stars out   monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate  caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrown open  and issued forth  then  what submission  what cringing and fawning  what servility  what abject humiliation  as to bowing down in body and spirit  nothing in that way was left for heaven  which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never troubled it   bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there  a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another  monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of truth  there  monseigneur turned  and came back again  and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites  and was seen no more   the show being over  the flutter in the air became quite a little storm  and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs  there was soon but one person left of all the crowd  and he  with his hat under his arm and his snuff box in his hand  slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out    i devote you   said this person  stopping at the last door on his way  and turning in the direction of the sanctuary   to the devil    with that  he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet  and quietly walked downstairs   he was a man of about sixty  handsomely dressed  haughty in manner  and with a face like a fine mask  a face of a transparent paleness  every feature in it clearly defined  one set expression on it  the nose  beautifully formed otherwise  was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril  in those two compressions  or dints  the only little change that the face ever showed  resided  they persisted in changing colour sometimes  and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation  then  they gave a look of treachery  and cruelty  to the whole countenance  examined with attention  its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth  and the lines of the orbits of the eyes  being much too horizontal and thin  still  in the effect of the face made  it was a handsome face  and a remarkable one   its owner went downstairs into the courtyard  got into his carriage  and drove away  not many people had talked with him at the reception  he had stood in a little space apart  and monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner  it appeared  under the circumstances  rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses  and often barely escaping from being run down  his man drove as if he were charging an enemy  and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face  or to the lips  of the master  the complaint had sometimes made itself audible  even in that deaf city and dumb age  that  in the narrow streets without footways  the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner  but  few cared enough for that to think of it a second time  and  in this matter  as in all others  the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could   with a wild rattle and clatter  and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days  the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners  with women screaming before it  and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way  at last  swooping at a street corner by a fountain  one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt  and there was a loud cry from a number of voices  and the horses reared and plunged   but for the latter inconvenience  the carriage probably would not have stopped  carriages were often known to drive on  and leave their wounded behind  and why not  but the frightened valet had got down in a hurry  and there were twenty hands at the horses  bridles    what has gone wrong   said monsieur  calmly looking out   a tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses  and had laid it on the basement of the fountain  and was down in the mud and wet  howling over it like a wild animal    pardon  monsieur the marquis   said a ragged and submissive man   it is a child     why does he make that abominable noise  is it his child     excuse me  monsieur the marquis  it is a pity  yes    the fountain was a little removed  for the street opened  where it was  into a space some ten or twelve yards square  as the tall man suddenly got up from the ground  and came running at the carriage  monsieur the marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword hilt    killed   shrieked the man  in wild desperation  extending both arms at their length above his head  and staring at him   dead    the people closed round  and looked at monsieur the marquis  there was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness  there was no visible menacing or anger  neither did the people say anything  after the first cry  they had been silent  and they remained so  the voice of the submissive man who had spoken  was flat and tame in its extreme submission  monsieur the marquis ran his eyes over them all  as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes   he took out his purse    it is extraordinary to me   said he   that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children  one or the other of you is for ever in the way  how do i know what injury you have done my horses  see  give him that    he threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up  and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell  the tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry   dead    he was arrested by the quick arrival of another man  for whom the rest made way  on seeing him  the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder  sobbing and crying  and pointing to the fountain  where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle  and moving gently about it  they were as silent  however  as the men    i know all  i know all   said the last comer   be a brave man  my gaspard  it is better for the poor little plaything to die so  than to live  it has died in a moment without pain  could it have lived an hour as happily     you are a philosopher  you there   said the marquis  smiling   how do they call you     they call me defarge     of what trade     monsieur the marquis  vendor of wine     pick up that  philosopher and vendor of wine   said the marquis  throwing him another gold coin   and spend it as you will  the horses there  are they right    without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time  monsieur the marquis leaned back in his seat  and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing  and had paid for it  and could afford to pay for it  when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage  and ringing on its floor    hold   said monsieur the marquis   hold the horses  who threw that    he looked to the spot where defarge the vendor of wine had stood  a moment before  but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot  and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman  knitting    you dogs   said the marquis  but smoothly  and with an unchanged front  except as to the spots on his nose   i would ride over any of you very willingly  and exterminate you from the earth  if i knew which rascal threw at the carriage  and if that brigand were sufficiently near it  he should be crushed under the wheels    so cowed was their condition  and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them  within the law and beyond it  that not a voice  or a hand  or even an eye was raised  among the men  not one  but the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily  and looked the marquis in the face  it was not for his dignity to notice it  his contemptuous eyes passed over her  and over all the other rats  and he leaned back in his seat again  and gave the word  go on    he was driven on  and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession  the minister  the state projector  the farmer general  the doctor  the lawyer  the ecclesiastic  the grand opera  the comedy  the whole fancy ball in a bright continuous flow  came whirling by  the rats had crept out of their holes to look on  and they remained looking on for hours  soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle  and making a barrier behind which they slunk  and through which they peeped  the father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it  when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain  sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the fancy ball  when the one woman who had stood conspicuous  knitting  still knitted on with the steadfastness of fate  the water of the fountain ran  the swift river ran  the day ran into evening  so much life in the city ran into death according to rule  time and tide waited for no man  the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again  the fancy ball was lighted up at supper  all things ran their course      viii  monseigneur in the country   a beautiful landscape  with the corn bright in it  but not abundant  patches of poor rye where corn should have been  patches of poor peas and beans  patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat  on inanimate nature  as on the men and women who cultivated it  a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly  a dejected disposition to give up  and wither away   monsieur the marquis in his travelling carriage  which might have been lighter   conducted by four post horses and two postilions  fagged up a steep hill  a blush on the countenance of monsieur the marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding  it was not from within  it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control  the setting sun   the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill top  that its occupant was steeped in crimson   it will die out   said monsieur the marquis  glancing at his hands   directly    in effect  the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment  when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel  and the carriage slid down hill  with a cinderous smell  in a cloud of dust  the red glow departed quickly  the sun and the marquis going down together  there was no glow left when the drag was taken off   but  there remained a broken country  bold and open  a little village at the bottom of the hill  a broad sweep and rise beyond it  a church tower  a windmill  a forest for the chase  and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison  round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on  the marquis looked  with the air of one who was coming near home   the village had its one poor street  with its poor brewery  poor tannery  poor tavern  poor stable yard for relays of post horses  poor fountain  all usual poor appointments  it had its poor people too  all its people were poor  and many of them were sitting at their doors  shredding spare onions and the like for supper  while many were at the fountain  washing leaves  and grasses  and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten  expressive signs of what made them poor  were not wanting  the tax for the state  the tax for the church  the tax for the lord  tax local and tax general  were to be paid here and to be paid there  according to solemn inscription in the little village  until the wonder was  that there was any village left unswallowed   few children were to be seen  and no dogs  as to the men and women  their choice on earth was stated in the prospect  life on the lowest terms that could sustain it  down in the little village under the mill  or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag   heralded by a courier in advance  and by the cracking of his postilions  whips  which twined snake like about their heads in the evening air  as if he came attended by the furies  monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the posting house gate  it was hard by the fountain  and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him  he looked at them  and saw in them  without knowing it  the slow sure filing down of misery worn face and figure  that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years   monsieur the marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him  as the like of himself had drooped before monseigneur of the court  only the difference was  that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate  when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group    bring me hither that fellow   said the marquis to the courier   the fellow was brought  cap in hand  and the other fellows closed round to look and listen  in the manner of the people at the paris fountain    i passed you on the road     monseigneur  it is true  i had the honour of being passed on the road     coming up the hill  and at the top of the hill  both     monseigneur  it is true     what did you look at  so fixedly     monseigneur  i looked at the man    he stooped a little  and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage  all his fellows stooped to look under the carriage    what man  pig  and why look there     pardon  monseigneur  he swung by the chain of the shoe  the drag     who   demanded the traveller    monseigneur  the man     may the devil carry away these idiots  how do you call the man  you know all the men of this part of the country  who was he     your clemency  monseigneur  he was not of this part of the country  of all the days of my life  i never saw him     swinging by the chain  to be suffocated     with your gracious permission  that was the wonder of it  monseigneur  his head hanging over  like this    he turned himself sideways to the carriage  and leaned back  with his face thrown up to the sky  and his head hanging down  then recovered himself  fumbled with his cap  and made a bow    what was he like     monseigneur  he was whiter than the miller  all covered with dust  white as a spectre  tall as a spectre    the picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd  but all eyes  without comparing notes with other eyes  looked at monsieur the marquis  perhaps  to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience    truly  you did well   said the marquis  felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him   to see a thief accompanying my carriage  and not open that great mouth of yours  bah  put him aside  monsieur gabelle    monsieur gabelle was the postmaster  and some other taxing functionary united  he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination  and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner    bah  go aside   said monsieur gabelle    lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to night  and be sure that his business is honest  gabelle     monseigneur  i am flattered to devote myself to your orders     did he run away  fellow   where is that accursed    the accursed was already under the carriage with some half dozen particular friends  pointing out the chain with his blue cap  some half dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out  and presented him breathless to monsieur the marquis    did the man run away  dolt  when we stopped for the drag     monseigneur  he precipitated himself over the hill side  head first  as a person plunges into the river     see to it  gabelle  go on    the half dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels  like sheep  the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones  they had very little else to save  or they might not have been so fortunate   the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond  was soon checked by the steepness of the hill  gradually  it subsided to a foot pace  swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night  the postilions  with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the furies  quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses  the courier was audible  trotting on ahead into the dull distance   at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground  with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it  it was a poor figure in wood  done by some inexperienced rustic carver  but he had studied the figure from the life  his own life  maybe  for it was dreadfully spare and thin   to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse  and was not at its worst  a woman was kneeling  she turned her head as the carriage came up to her  rose quickly  and presented herself at the carriage door    it is you  monseigneur  monseigneur  a petition    with an exclamation of impatience  but with his unchangeable face  monseigneur looked out    how  then  what is it  always petitions     monseigneur  for the love of the great god  my husband  the forester     what of your husband  the forester  always the same with you people  he cannot pay something     he has paid all  monseigneur  he is dead     well  he is quiet  can i restore him to you     alas  no  monseigneur  but he lies yonder  under a little heap of poor grass     well     monseigneur  there are so many little heaps of poor grass     again  well    she looked an old woman  but was young  her manner was one of passionate grief  by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy  and laid one of them on the carriage door  tenderly  caressingly  as if it had been a human breast  and could be expected to feel the appealing touch    monseigneur  hear me  monseigneur  hear my petition  my husband died of want  so many die of want  so many more will die of want     again  well  can i feed them     monseigneur  the good god knows  but i don t ask it  my petition is  that a morsel of stone or wood  with my husband s name  may be placed over him to show where he lies  otherwise  the place will be quickly forgotten  it will never be found when i am dead of the same malady  i shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass  monseigneur  they are so many  they increase so fast  there is so much want  monseigneur  monseigneur    the valet had put her away from the door  the carriage had broken into a brisk trot  the postilions had quickened the pace  she was left far behind  and monseigneur  again escorted by the furies  was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau   the sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him  and rose  as the rain falls  impartially  on the dusty  ragged  and toil worn group at the fountain not far away  to whom the mender of roads  with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing  still enlarged upon his man like a spectre  as long as they could bear it  by degrees  as they could bear no more  they dropped off one by one  and lights twinkled in little casements  which lights  as the casements darkened  and more stars came out  seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished   the shadow of a large high roofed house  and of many over hanging trees  was upon monsieur the marquis by that time  and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau  as his carriage stopped  and the great door of his chateau was opened to him    monsieur charles  whom i expect  is he arrived from england     monseigneur  not yet       ix  the gorgon s head   it was a heavy mass of building  that chateau of monsieur the marquis  with a large stone courtyard before it  and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door  a stony business altogether  with heavy stone balustrades  and stone urns  and stone flowers  and stone faces of men  and stone heads of lions  in all directions  as if the gorgon s head had surveyed it  when it was finished  two centuries ago   up the broad flight of shallow steps  monsieur the marquis  flambeau preceded  went from his carriage  sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees  all else was so quiet  that the flambeau carried up the steps  and the other flambeau held at the great door  burnt as if they were in a close room of state  instead of being in the open night air  other sound than the owl s voice there was none  save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin  for  it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together  and then heave a long low sigh  and hold their breath again   the great door clanged behind him  and monsieur the marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boar spears  swords  and knives of the chase  grimmer with certain heavy riding rods and riding whips  of which many a peasant  gone to his benefactor death  had felt the weight when his lord was angry   avoiding the larger rooms  which were dark and made fast for the night  monsieur the marquis  with his flambeau bearer going on before  went up the staircase to a door in a corridor  this thrown open  admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms  his bed chamber and two others  high vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors  great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time  and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country  the fashion of the last louis but one  of the line that was never to break  the fourteenth louis  was conspicuous in their rich furniture  but  it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of france   a supper table was laid for two  in the third of the rooms  a round room  in one of the chateau s four extinguisher topped towers  a small lofty room  with its window wide open  and the wooden jalousie blinds closed  so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black  alternating with their broad lines of stone colour    my nephew   said the marquis  glancing at the supper preparation   they said he was not arrived    nor was he  but  he had been expected with monseigneur    ah  it is not probable he will arrive to night  nevertheless  leave the table as it is  i shall be ready in a quarter of an hour    in a quarter of an hour monseigneur was ready  and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper  his chair was opposite to the window  and he had taken his soup  and was raising his glass of bordeaux to his lips  when he put it down    what is that   he calmly asked  looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour    monseigneur  that     outside the blinds  open the blinds    it was done    well     monseigneur  it is nothing  the trees and the night are all that are here    the servant who spoke  had thrown the blinds wide  had looked out into the vacant darkness  and stood with that blank behind him  looking round for instructions    good   said the imperturbable master   close them again    that was done too  and the marquis went on with his supper  he was half way through it  when he again stopped with his glass in his hand  hearing the sound of wheels  it came on briskly  and came up to the front of the chateau    ask who is arrived    it was the nephew of monseigneur  he had been some few leagues behind monseigneur  early in the afternoon  he had diminished the distance rapidly  but not so rapidly as to come up with monseigneur on the road  he had heard of monseigneur  at the posting houses  as being before him   he was to be told  said monseigneur  that supper awaited him then and there  and that he was prayed to come to it  in a little while he came  he had been known in england as charles darnay   monseigneur received him in a courtly manner  but they did not shake hands    you left paris yesterday  sir   he said to monseigneur  as he took his seat at table    yesterday  and you     i come direct     from london     yes     you have been a long time coming   said the marquis  with a smile    on the contrary  i come direct     pardon me  i mean  not a long time on the journey  a long time intending the journey     i have been detained by   the nephew stopped a moment in his answer   various business     without doubt   said the polished uncle   so long as a servant was present  no other words passed between them  when coffee had been served and they were alone together  the nephew  looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask  opened a conversation    i have come back  sir  as you anticipate  pursuing the object that took me away  it carried me into great and unexpected peril  but it is a sacred object  and if it had carried me to death i hope it would have sustained me     not to death   said the uncle   it is not necessary to say  to death     i doubt  sir   returned the nephew   whether  if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death  you would have cared to stop me there    the deepened marks in the nose  and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face  looked ominous as to that  the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest  which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring    indeed  sir   pursued the nephew   for anything i know  you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me     no  no  no   said the uncle  pleasantly    but  however that may be   resumed the nephew  glancing at him with deep distrust   i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means  and would know no scruple as to means     my friend  i told you so   said the uncle  with a fine pulsation in the two marks   do me the favour to recall that i told you so  long ago     i recall it     thank you   said the marquis  very sweetly indeed   his tone lingered in the air  almost like the tone of a musical instrument    in effect  sir   pursued the nephew   i believe it to be at once your bad fortune  and my good fortune  that has kept me out of a prison in france here     i do not quite understand   returned the uncle  sipping his coffee   dare i ask you to explain     i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court  and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past  a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely     it is possible   said the uncle  with great calmness   for the honour of the family  i could even resolve to incommode you to that extent  pray excuse me     i perceive that  happily for me  the reception of the day before yesterday was  as usual  a cold one   observed the nephew    i would not say happily  my friend   returned the uncle  with refined politeness   i would not be sure of that  a good opportunity for consideration  surrounded by the advantages of solitude  might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself  but it is useless to discuss the question  i am  as you say  at a disadvantage  these little instruments of correction  these gentle aids to the power and honour of families  these slight favours that might so incommode you  are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity  they are sought by so many  and they are granted  comparatively  to so few  it used not to be so  but france in all such things is changed for the worse  our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar  from this room  many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged  in the next room  my bedroom   one fellow  to our knowledge  was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter  his daughter  we have lost many privileges  a new philosophy has become the mode  and the assertion of our station  in these days  might  i do not go so far as to say would  but might  cause us real inconvenience  all very bad  very bad    the marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff  and shook his head  as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself  that great means of regeneration    we have so asserted our station  both in the old time and in the modern time also   said the nephew  gloomily   that i believe our name to be more detested than any name in france     let us hope so   said the uncle   detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low     there is not   pursued the nephew  in his former tone   a face i can look at  in all this country round about us  which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery     a compliment   said the marquis   to the grandeur of the family  merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur  hah   and he took another gentle little pinch of snuff  and lightly crossed his legs   but  when his nephew  leaning an elbow on the table  covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand  the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness  closeness  and dislike  than was comportable with its wearer s assumption of indifference    repression is the only lasting philosophy  the dark deference of fear and slavery  my friend   observed the marquis   will keep the dogs obedient to the whip  as long as this roof   looking up to it   shuts out the sky    that might not be so long as the marquis supposed  if a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence  and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence  could have been shown to him that night  he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly  fire charred  plunder wrecked rains  as for the roof he vaunted  he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new way  to wit  for ever  from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired  out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets    meanwhile   said the marquis   i will preserve the honour and repose of the family  if you will not  but you must be fatigued  shall we terminate our conference for the night     a moment more     an hour  if you please     sir   said the nephew   we have done wrong  and are reaping the fruits of wrong     we have done wrong   repeated the marquis  with an inquiring smile  and delicately pointing  first to his nephew  then to himself    our family  our honourable family  whose honour is of so much account to both of us  in such different ways  even in my father s time  we did a world of wrong  injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure  whatever it was  why need i speak of my father s time  when it is equally yours  can i separate my father s twin brother  joint inheritor  and next successor  from himself     death has done that   said the marquis    and has left me   answered the nephew   bound to a system that is frightful to me  responsible for it  but powerless in it  seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother s lips  and obey the last look of my dear mother s eyes  which implored me to have mercy and to redress  and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain     seeking them from me  my nephew   said the marquis  touching him on the breast with his forefinger  they were now standing by the hearth   you will for ever seek them in vain  be assured    every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face  was cruelly  craftily  and closely compressed  while he stood looking quietly at his nephew  with his snuff box in his hand  once again he touched him on the breast  as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword  with which  in delicate finesse  he ran him through the body  and said    my friend  i will die  perpetuating the system under which i have lived    when he had said it  he took a culminating pinch of snuff  and put his box in his pocket    better to be a rational creature   he added then  after ringing a small bell on the table   and accept your natural destiny  but you are lost  monsieur charles  i see     this property and france are lost to me   said the nephew  sadly   i renounce them     are they both yours to renounce  france may be  but is the property  it is scarcely worth mentioning  but  is it yet     i had no intention  in the words i used  to claim it yet  if it passed to me from you  to morrow      which i have the vanity to hope is not probable       or twenty years hence      you do me too much honour   said the marquis   still  i prefer that supposition       i would abandon it  and live otherwise and elsewhere  it is little to relinquish  what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin     hah   said the marquis  glancing round the luxurious room    to the eye it is fair enough  here  but seen in its integrity  under the sky  and by the daylight  it is a crumbling tower of waste  mismanagement  extortion  debt  mortgage  oppression  hunger  nakedness  and suffering     hah   said the marquis again  in a well satisfied manner    if it ever becomes mine  it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly  if such a thing is possible  from the weight that drags it down  so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance  may  in another generation  suffer less  but it is not for me  there is a curse on it  and on all this land     and you   said the uncle   forgive my curiosity  do you  under your new philosophy  graciously intend to live     i must do  to live  what others of my countrymen  even with nobility at their backs  may have to do some day  work     in england  for example     yes  the family honour  sir  is safe from me in this country  the family name can suffer from me in no other  for i bear it in no other    the ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed chamber to be lighted  it now shone brightly  through the door of communication  the marquis looked that way  and listened for the retreating step of his valet    england is very attractive to you  seeing how indifferently you have prospered there   he observed then  turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile    i have already said  that for my prospering there  i am sensible i may be indebted to you  sir  for the rest  it is my refuge     they say  those boastful english  that it is the refuge of many  you know a compatriot who has found a refuge there  a doctor     yes     with a daughter     yes     yes   said the marquis   you are fatigued  good night    as he bent his head in his most courtly manner  there was a secrecy in his smiling face  and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words  which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly  at the same time  the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes  and the thin straight lips  and the markings in the nose  curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic    yes   repeated the marquis   a doctor with a daughter  yes  so commences the new philosophy  you are fatigued  good night    it would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his  the nephew looked at him  in vain  in passing on to the door    good night   said the uncle   i look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning  good repose  light monsieur my nephew to his chamber there   and burn monsieur my nephew in his bed  if you will   he added to himself  before he rang his little bell again  and summoned his valet to his own bedroom   the valet come and gone  monsieur the marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber robe  to prepare himself gently for sleep  that hot still night  rustling about the room  his softly slippered feet making no noise on the floor  he moved like a refined tiger   looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort  in story  whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off  or just coming on   he moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom  looking again at the scraps of the day s journey that came unbidden into his mind  the slow toil up the hill at sunset  the setting sun  the descent  the mill  the prison on the crag  the little village in the hollow  the peasants at the fountain  and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage  that fountain suggested the paris fountain  the little bundle lying on the step  the women bending over it  and the tall man with his arms up  crying   dead     i am cool now   said monsieur the marquis   and may go to bed    so  leaving only one light burning on the large hearth  he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him  and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep   the stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours  for three heavy hours  the horses in the stables rattled at their racks  the dogs barked  and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men poets  but it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them   for three heavy hours  the stone faces of the chateau  lion and human  stared blindly at the night  dead darkness lay on all the landscape  dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads  the burial place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another  the figure on the cross might have come down  for anything that could be seen of it  in the village  taxers and taxed were fast asleep  dreaming  perhaps  of banquets  as the starved usually do  and of ease and rest  as the driven slave and the yoked ox may  its lean inhabitants slept soundly  and were fed and freed   the fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard  and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard  both melting away  like the minutes that were falling from the spring of time  through three dark hours  then  the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light  and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened   lighter and lighter  until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees  and poured its radiance over the hill  in the glow  the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood  and the stone faces crimsoned  the carol of the birds was loud and high  and  on the weather beaten sill of the great window of the bed chamber of monsieur the marquis  one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might  at this  the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed  and  with open mouth and dropped under jaw  looked awe stricken   now  the sun was full up  and movement began in the village  casement windows opened  crazy doors were unbarred  and people came forth shivering  chilled  as yet  by the new sweet air  then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population  some  to the fountain  some  to the fields  men and women here  to dig and delve  men and women there  to see to the poor live stock  and lead the bony cows out  to such pasture as could be found by the roadside  in the church and at the cross  a kneeling figure or two  attendant on the latter prayers  the led cow  trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot   the chateau awoke later  as became its quality  but awoke gradually and surely  first  the lonely boar spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old  then  had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine  now  doors and windows were thrown open  horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways  leaves sparkled and rustled at iron grated windows  dogs pulled hard at their chains  and reared impatient to be loosed   all these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life  and the return of morning  surely  not so the ringing of the great bell of the chateau  nor the running up and down the stairs  nor the hurried figures on the terrace  nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere  nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away   what winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads  already at work on the hill top beyond the village  with his day s dinner  not much to carry  lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow s while to peck at  on a heap of stones  had the birds  carrying some grains of it to a distance  dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds  whether or no  the mender of roads ran  on the sultry morning  as if for his life  down the hill  knee high in dust  and never stopped till he got to the fountain   all the people of the village were at the fountain  standing about in their depressed manner  and whispering low  but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise  the led cows  hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them  were looking stupidly on  or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble  which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter  some of the people of the chateau  and some of those of the posting house  and all the taxing authorities  were armed more or less  and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way  that was highly fraught with nothing  already  the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends  and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap  what did all this portend  and what portended the swift hoisting up of monsieur gabelle behind a servant on horseback  and the conveying away of the said gabelle  double laden though the horse was   at a gallop  like a new version of the german ballad of leonora   it portended that there was one stone face too many  up at the chateau   the gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night  and had added the one stone face wanting  the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years   it lay back on the pillow of monsieur the marquis  it was like a fine mask  suddenly startled  made angry  and petrified  driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it  was a knife  round its hilt was a frill of paper  on which was scrawled    drive him fast to his tomb  this  from jacques       x  two promises   more months  to the number of twelve  had come and gone  and mr  charles darnay was established in england as a higher teacher of the french language who was conversant with french literature  in this age  he would have been a professor  in that age  he was a tutor  he read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world  and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy  he could write of them  besides  in sound english  and render them into sound english  such masters were not at that time easily found  princes that had been  and kings that were to be  were not yet of the teacher class  and no ruined nobility had dropped out of tellson s ledgers  to turn cooks and carpenters  as a tutor  whose attainments made the student s way unusually pleasant and profitable  and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge  young mr  darnay soon became known and encouraged  he was well acquainted  more over  with the circumstances of his country  and those were of ever growing interest  so  with great perseverance and untiring industry  he prospered   in london  he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold  nor to lie on beds of roses  if he had had any such exalted expectation  he would not have prospered  he had expected labour  and he found it  and did it and made the best of it  in this  his prosperity consisted   a certain portion of his time was passed at cambridge  where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in european languages  instead of conveying greek and latin through the custom house  the rest of his time he passed in london   now  from the days when it was always summer in eden  to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes  the world of a man has invariably gone one way  charles darnay s way  the way of the love of a woman   he had loved lucie manette from the hour of his danger  he had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice  he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful  as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him  but  he had not yet spoken to her on the subject  the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long  long  dusty roads  the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream  had been done a year  and he had never yet  by so much as a single spoken word  disclosed to her the state of his heart   that he had his reasons for this  he knew full well  it was again a summer day when  lately arrived in london from his college occupation  he turned into the quiet corner in soho  bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to doctor manette  it was the close of the summer day  and he knew lucie to be out with miss pross   he found the doctor reading in his arm chair at a window  the energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness  had been gradually restored to him  he was now a very energetic man indeed  with great firmness of purpose  strength of resolution  and vigour of action  in his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden  as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties  but  this had never been frequently observable  and had grown more and more rare   he studied much  slept little  sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease  and was equably cheerful  to him  now entered charles darnay  at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand    charles darnay  i rejoice to see you  we have been counting on your return these three or four days past  mr  stryver and sydney carton were both here yesterday  and both made you out to be more than due     i am obliged to them for their interest in the matter   he answered  a little coldly as to them  though very warmly as to the doctor   miss manette      is well   said the doctor  as he stopped short   and your return will delight us all  she has gone out on some household matters  but will soon be home     doctor manette  i knew she was from home  i took the opportunity of her being from home  to beg to speak to you    there was a blank silence    yes   said the doctor  with evident constraint   bring your chair here  and speak on    he complied as to the chair  but appeared to find the speaking on less easy    i have had the happiness  doctor manette  of being so intimate here    so he at length began   for some year and a half  that i hope the topic on which i am about to touch may not     he was stayed by the doctor s putting out his hand to stop him  when he had kept it so a little while  he said  drawing it back    is lucie the topic     she is     it is hard for me to speak of her at any time  it is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours  charles darnay     it is a tone of fervent admiration  true homage  and deep love  doctor manette   he said deferentially   there was another blank silence before her father rejoined    i believe it  i do you justice  i believe it    his constraint was so manifest  and it was so manifest  too  that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject  that charles darnay hesitated    shall i go on  sir    another blank    yes  go on     you anticipate what i would say  though you cannot know how earnestly i say it  how earnestly i feel it  without knowing my secret heart  and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden  dear doctor manette  i love your daughter fondly  dearly  disinterestedly  devotedly  if ever there were love in the world  i love her  you have loved yourself  let your old love speak for me    the doctor sat with his face turned away  and his eyes bent on the ground  at the last words  he stretched out his hand again  hurriedly  and cried    not that  sir  let that be  i adjure you  do not recall that    his cry was so like a cry of actual pain  that it rang in charles darnay s ears long after he had ceased  he motioned with the hand he had extended  and it seemed to be an appeal to darnay to pause  the latter so received it  and remained silent    i ask your pardon   said the doctor  in a subdued tone  after some moments   i do not doubt your loving lucie  you may be satisfied of it    he turned towards him in his chair  but did not look at him  or raise his eyes  his chin dropped upon his hand  and his white hair overshadowed his face    have you spoken to lucie     no     nor written     never     it would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father  her father thanks you    he offered his hand  but his eyes did not go with it    i know   said darnay  respectfully   how can i fail to know  doctor manette  i who have seen you together from day to day  that between you and miss manette there is an affection so unusual  so touching  so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured  that it can have few parallels  even in the tenderness between a father and child  i know  doctor manette  how can i fail to know  that  mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman  there is  in her heart  towards you  all the love and reliance of infancy itself  i know that  as in her childhood she had no parent  so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character  united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her  i know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life  you could hardly be invested  in her sight  with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her  i know that when she is clinging to you  the hands of baby  girl  and woman  all in one  are round your neck  i know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age  sees and loves you at my age  loves her mother broken hearted  loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration  i have known this  night and day  since i have known you in your home    her father sat silent  with his face bent down  his breathing was a little quickened  but he repressed all other signs of agitation    dear doctor manette  always knowing this  always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you  i have forborne  and forborne  as long as it was in the nature of man to do it  i have felt  and do even now feel  that to bring my love  even mine  between you  is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself  but i love her  heaven is my witness that i love her     i believe it   answered her father  mournfully   i have thought so before now  i believe it     but  do not believe   said darnay  upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound   that if my fortune were so cast as that  being one day so happy as to make her my wife  i must at any time put any separation between her and you  i could or would breathe a word of what i now say  besides that i should know it to be hopeless  i should know it to be a baseness  if i had any such possibility  even at a remote distance of years  harboured in my thoughts  and hidden in my heart  if it ever had been there  if it ever could be there  i could not now touch this honoured hand    he laid his own upon it as he spoke    no  dear doctor manette  like you  a voluntary exile from france  like you  driven from it by its distractions  oppressions  and miseries  like you  striving to live away from it by my own exertions  and trusting in a happier future  i look only to sharing your fortunes  sharing your life and home  and being faithful to you to the death  not to divide with lucie her privilege as your child  companion  and friend  but to come in aid of it  and bind her closer to you  if such a thing can be    his touch still lingered on her father s hand  answering the touch for a moment  but not coldly  her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair  and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference  a struggle was evidently in his face  a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread    you speak so feelingly and so manfully  charles darnay  that i thank you with all my heart  and will open all my heart  or nearly so  have you any reason to believe that lucie loves you     none  as yet  none     is it the immediate object of this confidence  that you may at once ascertain that  with my knowledge     not even so  i might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks  i might  mistaken or not mistaken  have that hopefulness to morrow     do you seek any guidance from me     i ask none  sir  but i have thought it possible that you might have it in your power  if you should deem it right  to give me some     do you seek any promise from me     i do seek that     what is it     i well understand that  without you  i could have no hope  i well understand that  even if miss manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart  do not think i have the presumption to assume so much  i could retain no place in it against her love for her father     if that be so  do you see what  on the other hand  is involved in it     i understand equally well  that a word from her father in any suitor s favour  would outweigh herself and all the world  for which reason  doctor manette   said darnay  modestly but firmly   i would not ask that word  to save my life     i am sure of it  charles darnay  mysteries arise out of close love  as well as out of wide division  in the former case  they are subtle and delicate  and difficult to penetrate  my daughter lucie is  in this one respect  such a mystery to me  i can make no guess at the state of her heart     may i ask  sir  if you think she is    as he hesitated  her father supplied the rest    is sought by any other suitor     it is what i meant to say    her father considered a little before he answered    you have seen mr  carton here  yourself  mr  stryver is here too  occasionally  if it be at all  it can only be by one of these     or both   said darnay    i had not thought of both  i should not think either  likely  you want a promise from me  tell me what it is     it is  that if miss manette should bring to you at any time  on her own part  such a confidence as i have ventured to lay before you  you will bear testimony to what i have said  and to your belief in it  i hope you may be able to think so well of me  as to urge no influence against me  i say nothing more of my stake in this  this is what i ask  the condition on which i ask it  and which you have an undoubted right to require  i will observe immediately     i give the promise   said the doctor   without any condition  i believe your object to be  purely and truthfully  as you have stated it  i believe your intention is to perpetuate  and not to weaken  the ties between me and my other and far dearer self  if she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness  i will give her to you  if there were  charles darnay  if there were     the young man had taken his hand gratefully  their hands were joined as the doctor spoke      any fancies  any reasons  any apprehensions  anything whatsoever  new or old  against the man she really loved  the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head  they should all be obliterated for her sake  she is everything to me  more to me than suffering  more to me than wrong  more to me  well  this is idle talk    so strange was the way in which he faded into silence  and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak  that darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it    you said something to me   said doctor manette  breaking into a smile   what was it you said to me    he was at a loss how to answer  until he remembered having spoken of a condition  relieved as his mind reverted to that  he answered    your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part  my present name  though but slightly changed from my mother s  is not  as you will remember  my own  i wish to tell you what that is  and why i am in england     stop   said the doctor of beauvais    i wish it  that i may the better deserve your confidence  and have no secret from you     stop    for an instant  the doctor even had his two hands at his ears  for another instant  even had his two hands laid on darnay s lips    tell me when i ask you  not now  if your suit should prosper  if lucie should love you  you shall tell me on your marriage morning  do you promise     willingly    give me your hand  she will be home directly  and it is better she should not see us together to night  go  god bless you    it was dark when charles darnay left him  and it was an hour later and darker when lucie came home  she hurried into the room alone  for miss pross had gone straight up stairs  and was surprised to find his reading chair empty    my father   she called to him   father dear    nothing was said in answer  but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom  passing lightly across the intermediate room  she looked in at his door and came running back frightened  crying to herself  with her blood all chilled   what shall i do  what shall i do    her uncertainty lasted but a moment  she hurried back  and tapped at his door  and softly called to him  the noise ceased at the sound of her voice  and he presently came out to her  and they walked up and down together for a long time   she came down from her bed  to look at him in his sleep that night  he slept heavily  and his tray of shoemaking tools  and his old unfinished work  were all as usual      xi  a companion picture    sydney   said mr  stryver  on that self same night  or morning  to his jackal   mix another bowl of punch  i have something to say to you    sydney had been working double tides that night  and the night before  and the night before that  and a good many nights in succession  making a grand clearance among mr  stryver s papers before the setting in of the long vacation  the clearance was effected at last  the stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up  everything was got rid of until november should come with its fogs atmospheric  and fogs legal  and bring grist to the mill again   sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application  it had taken a deal of extra wet towelling to pull him through the night  a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling  and he was in a very damaged condition  as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours    are you mixing that other bowl of punch   said stryver the portly  with his hands in his waistband  glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back    i am     now  look here  i am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you  and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me  i intend to marry     do you     yes  and not for money  what do you say now     i don t feel disposed to say much  who is she     guess     do i know her     guess     i am not going to guess  at five o clock in the morning  with my brains frying and sputtering in my head  if you want me to guess  you must ask me to dinner     well then  i ll tell you   said stryver  coming slowly into a sitting posture   sydney  i rather despair of making myself intelligible to you  because you are such an insensible dog     and you   returned sydney  busy concocting the punch   are such a sensitive and poetical spirit      come   rejoined stryver  laughing boastfully   though i don t prefer any claim to being the soul of romance  for i hope i know better   still i am a tenderer sort of fellow than you     you are a luckier  if you mean that     i don t mean that  i mean i am a man of more  more      say gallantry  while you are about it   suggested carton    well  i ll say gallantry  my meaning is that i am a man   said stryver  inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch   who cares more to be agreeable  who takes more pains to be agreeable  who knows better how to be agreeable  in a woman s society  than you do     go on   said sydney carton    no  but before i go on   said stryver  shaking his head in his bullying way   i ll have this out with you  you ve been at doctor manette s house as much as i have  or more than i have  why  i have been ashamed of your moroseness there  your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind  that  upon my life and soul  i have been ashamed of you  sydney     it should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar  to be ashamed of anything   returned sydney   you ought to be much obliged to me     you shall not get off in that way   rejoined stryver  shouldering the rejoinder at him   no  sydney  it s my duty to tell you  and i tell you to your face to do you good  that you are a devilish ill conditioned fellow in that sort of society  you are a disagreeable fellow    sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made  and laughed    look at me   said stryver  squaring himself   i have less need to make myself agreeable than you have  being more independent in circumstances  why do i do it     i never saw you do it yet   muttered carton    i do it because it s politic  i do it on principle  and look at me  i get on     you don t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions    answered carton  with a careless air   i wish you would keep to that  as to me  will you never understand that i am incorrigible    he asked the question with some appearance of scorn    you have no business to be incorrigible   was his friend s answer  delivered in no very soothing tone    i have no business to be  at all  that i know of   said sydney carton   who is the lady     now  don t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable  sydney   said mr  stryver  preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make   because i know you don t mean half you say  and if you meant it all  it would be of no importance  i make this little preface  because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms     i did     certainly  and in these chambers    sydney carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend  drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend    you made mention of the young lady as a golden haired doll  the young lady is miss manette  if you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way  sydney  i might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation  but you are not  you want that sense altogether  therefore i am no more annoyed when i think of the expression  than i should be annoyed by a man s opinion of a picture of mine  who had no eye for pictures  or of a piece of music of mine  who had no ear for music    sydney carton drank the punch at a great rate  drank it by bumpers  looking at his friend    now you know all about it  syd   said mr  stryver   i don t care about fortune  she is a charming creature  and i have made up my mind to please myself  on the whole  i think i can afford to please myself  she will have in me a man already pretty well off  and a rapidly rising man  and a man of some distinction  it is a piece of good fortune for her  but she is worthy of good fortune  are you astonished    carton  still drinking the punch  rejoined   why should i be astonished     you approve    carton  still drinking the punch  rejoined   why should i not approve     well   said his friend stryver   you take it more easily than i fancied you would  and are less mercenary on my behalf than i thought you would be  though  to be sure  you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will  yes  sydney  i have had enough of this style of life  with no other as a change from it  i feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it  when he doesn t  he can stay away   and i feel that miss manette will tell well in any station  and will always do me credit  so i have made up my mind  and now  sydney  old boy  i want to say a word to you about your prospects  you are in a bad way  you know  you really are in a bad way  you don t know the value of money  you live hard  you ll knock up one of these days  and be ill and poor  you really ought to think about a nurse    the prosperous patronage with which he said it  made him look twice as big as he was  and four times as offensive    now  let me recommend you   pursued stryver   to look it in the face  i have looked it in the face  in my different way  look it in the face  you  in your different way  marry  provide somebody to take care of you  never mind your having no enjoyment of women s society  nor understanding of it  nor tact for it  find out somebody  find out some respectable woman with a little property  somebody in the landlady way  or lodging letting way  and marry her  against a rainy day  that s the kind of thing for you  now think of it  sydney     i ll think of it   said sydney      xii  the fellow of delicacy   mr  stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the doctor s daughter  resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the long vacation  after some mental debating of the point  he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with  and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before michaelmas term  or in the little christmas vacation between it and hilary   as to the strength of his case  he had not a doubt about it  but clearly saw his way to the verdict  argued with the jury on substantial worldly grounds  the only grounds ever worth taking into account  it was a plain case  and had not a weak spot in it  he called himself for the plaintiff  there was no getting over his evidence  the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief  and the jury did not even turn to consider  after trying it  stryver  c  j   was satisfied that no plainer case could be   accordingly  mr  stryver inaugurated the long vacation with a formal proposal to take miss manette to vauxhall gardens  that failing  to ranelagh  that unaccountably failing too  it behoved him to present himself in soho  and there declare his noble mind   towards soho  therefore  mr  stryver shouldered his way from the temple  while the bloom of the long vacation s infancy was still upon it  anybody who had seen him projecting himself into soho while he was yet on saint dunstan s side of temple bar  bursting in his full blown way along the pavement  to the jostlement of all weaker people  might have seen how safe and strong he was   his way taking him past tellson s  and he both banking at tellson s and knowing mr  lorry as the intimate friend of the manettes  it entered mr  stryver s mind to enter the bank  and reveal to mr  lorry the brightness of the soho horizon  so  he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat  stumbled down the two steps  got past the two ancient cashiers  and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where mr  lorry sat at great books ruled for figures  with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too  and everything under the clouds were a sum    halloa   said mr  stryver   how do you do  i hope you are well    it was stryver s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place  or space  he was so much too big for tellson s  that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance  as though he squeezed them against the wall  the house itself  magnificently reading the paper quite in the far off perspective  lowered displeased  as if the stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat   the discreet mr  lorry said  in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances   how do you do  mr  stryver  how do you do  sir   and shook hands  there was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands  always to be seen in any clerk at tellson s who shook hands with a customer when the house pervaded the air  he shook in a self abnegating way  as one who shook for tellson and co    can i do anything for you  mr  stryver   asked mr  lorry  in his business character    why  no  thank you  this is a private visit to yourself  mr  lorry  i have come for a private word     oh indeed   said mr  lorry  bending down his ear  while his eye strayed to the house afar off    i am going   said mr  stryver  leaning his arms confidentially on the desk  whereupon  although it was a large double one  there appeared to be not half desk enough for him   i am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend  miss manette  mr  lorry     oh dear me   cried mr  lorry  rubbing his chin  and looking at his visitor dubiously    oh dear me  sir   repeated stryver  drawing back   oh dear you  sir  what may your meaning be  mr  lorry     my meaning   answered the man of business   is  of course  friendly and appreciative  and that it does you the greatest credit  and  in short  my meaning is everything you could desire  but  really  you know  mr  stryver    mr  lorry paused  and shook his head at him in the oddest manner  as if he were compelled against his will to add  internally   you know there really is so much too much of you     well   said stryver  slapping the desk with his contentious hand  opening his eyes wider  and taking a long breath   if i understand you  mr  lorry  i ll be hanged    mr  lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end  and bit the feather of a pen    d  n it all  sir   said stryver  staring at him   am i not eligible     oh dear yes  yes  oh yes  you re eligible   said mr  lorry   if you say eligible  you are eligible     am i not prosperous   asked stryver    oh  if you come to prosperous  you are prosperous   said mr  lorry    and advancing     if you come to advancing you know   said mr  lorry  delighted to be able to make another admission   nobody can doubt that     then what on earth is your meaning  mr  lorry   demanded stryver  perceptibly crestfallen    well  i  were you going there now   asked mr  lorry    straight   said stryver  with a plump of his fist on the desk    then i think i wouldn t  if i was you     why   said stryver   now  i ll put you in a corner   forensically shaking a forefinger at him   you are a man of business and bound to have a reason  state your reason  why wouldn t you go     because   said mr  lorry   i wouldn t go on such an object without having some cause to believe that i should succeed     d  n me   cried stryver   but this beats everything    mr  lorry glanced at the distant house  and glanced at the angry stryver    here s a man of business  a man of years  a man of experience  in a bank   said stryver   and having summed up three leading reasons for complete success  he says there s no reason at all  says it with his head on   mr  stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off    when i speak of success  i speak of success with the young lady  and when i speak of causes and reasons to make success probable  i speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady  the young lady  my good sir   said mr  lorry  mildly tapping the stryver arm   the young lady  the young lady goes before all     then you mean to tell me  mr  lorry   said stryver  squaring his elbows   that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing fool     not exactly so  i mean to tell you  mr  stryver   said mr  lorry  reddening   that i will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips  and that if i knew any man  which i hope i do not  whose taste was so coarse  and whose temper was so overbearing  that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk  not even tellson s should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind    the necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put mr  stryver s blood vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry  mr  lorry s veins  methodical as their courses could usually be  were in no better state now it was his turn    that is what i mean to tell you  sir   said mr  lorry   pray let there be no mistake about it    mr  stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while  and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it  which probably gave him the toothache  he broke the awkward silence by saying    this is something new to me  mr  lorry  you deliberately advise me not to go up to soho and offer myself  myself  stryver of the king s bench bar     do you ask me for my advice  mr  stryver     yes  i do     very good  then i give it  and you have repeated it correctly     and all i can say of it is   laughed stryver with a vexed laugh   that this  ha  ha   beats everything past  present  and to come     now understand me   pursued mr  lorry   as a man of business  i am not justified in saying anything about this matter  for  as a man of business  i know nothing of it  but  as an old fellow  who has carried miss manette in his arms  who is the trusted friend of miss manette and of her father too  and who has a great affection for them both  i have spoken  the confidence is not of my seeking  recollect  now  you think i may not be right     not i   said stryver  whistling   i can t undertake to find third parties in common sense  i can only find it for myself  i suppose sense in certain quarters  you suppose mincing bread and butter nonsense  it s new to me  but you are right  i dare say     what i suppose  mr  stryver  i claim to characterise for myself  and understand me  sir   said mr  lorry  quickly flushing again   i will not  not even at tellson s  have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing     there  i beg your pardon   said stryver    granted  thank you  well  mr  stryver  i was about to say   it might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken  it might be painful to doctor manette to have the task of being explicit with you  it might be very painful to miss manette to have the task of being explicit with you  you know the terms upon which i have the honour and happiness to stand with the family  if you please  committing you in no way  representing you in no way  i will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it  if you should then be dissatisfied with it  you can but test its soundness for yourself  if  on the other hand  you should be satisfied with it  and it should be what it now is  it may spare all sides what is best spared  what do you say     how long would you keep me in town     oh  it is only a question of a few hours  i could go to soho in the evening  and come to your chambers afterwards     then i say yes   said stryver   i won t go up there now  i am not so hot upon it as that comes to  i say yes  and i shall expect you to look in to night  good morning    then mr  stryver turned and burst out of the bank  causing such a concussion of air on his passage through  that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters  required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks  those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing  and were popularly believed  when they had bowed a customer out  still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in   the barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty  unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow  he got it down   and now   said mr  stryver  shaking his forensic forefinger at the temple in general  when it was down   my way out of this  is  to put you all in the wrong    it was a bit of the art of an old bailey tactician  in which he found great relief   you shall not put me in the wrong  young lady   said mr  stryver   i ll do that for you    accordingly  when mr  lorry called that night as late as ten o clock  mr  stryver  among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose  seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning  he even showed surprise when he saw mr  lorry  and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state    well   said that good natured emissary  after a full half hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question   i have been to soho     to soho   repeated mr  stryver  coldly   oh  to be sure  what am i thinking of     and i have no doubt   said mr  lorry   that i was right in the conversation we had  my opinion is confirmed  and i reiterate my advice     i assure you   returned mr  stryver  in the friendliest way   that i am sorry for it on your account  and sorry for it on the poor father s account  i know this must always be a sore subject with the family  let us say no more about it     i don t understand you   said mr  lorry    i dare say not   rejoined stryver  nodding his head in a smoothing and final way   no matter  no matter     but it does matter   mr  lorry urged    no it doesn t  i assure you it doesn t  having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense  and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition  i am well out of my mistake  and no harm is done  young women have committed similar follies often before  and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before  in an unselfish aspect  i am sorry that the thing is dropped  because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view  in a selfish aspect  i am glad that the thing has dropped  because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view  it is hardly necessary to say i could have gained nothing by it  there is no harm at all done  i have not proposed to the young lady  and  between ourselves  i am by no means certain  on reflection  that i ever should have committed myself to that extent  mr  lorry  you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty headed girls  you must not expect to do it  or you will always be disappointed  now  pray say no more about it  i tell you  i regret it on account of others  but i am satisfied on my own account  and i am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you  and for giving me your advice  you know the young lady better than i do  you were right  it never would have done    mr  lorry was so taken aback  that he looked quite stupidly at mr  stryver shouldering him towards the door  with an appearance of showering generosity  forbearance  and goodwill  on his erring head   make the best of it  my dear sir   said stryver   say no more about it  thank you again for allowing me to sound you  good night    mr  lorry was out in the night  before he knew where he was  mr  stryver was lying back on his sofa  winking at his ceiling      xiii  the fellow of no delicacy   if sydney carton ever shone anywhere  he certainly never shone in the house of doctor manette  he had been there often  during a whole year  and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there  when he cared to talk  he talked well  but  the cloud of caring for nothing  which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness  was very rarely pierced by the light within him   and yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house  and for the senseless stones that made their pavements  many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there  when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him  many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there  and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief  removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings  as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things  else forgotten and unattainable  into his mind  of late  the neglected bed in the temple court had known him more scantily than ever  and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes  he had got up again  and haunted that neighbourhood   on a day in august  when mr  stryver  after notifying to his jackal that  he had thought better of that marrying matter   had carried his delicacy into devonshire  and when the sight and scent of flowers in the city streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst  of health for the sickliest  and of youth for the oldest  sydney s feet still trod those stones  from being irresolute and purposeless  his feet became animated by an intention  and  in the working out of that intention  they took him to the doctor s door   he was shown up stairs  and found lucie at her work  alone  she had never been quite at her ease with him  and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table  but  looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common places  she observed a change in it    i fear you are not well  mr  carton     no  but the life i lead  miss manette  is not conducive to health  what is to be expected of  or by  such profligates     is it not  forgive me  i have begun the question on my lips  a pity to live no better life     god knows it is a shame     then why not change it    looking gently at him again  she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes  there were tears in his voice too  as he answered    it is too late for that  i shall never be better than i am  i shall sink lower  and be worse    he leaned an elbow on her table  and covered his eyes with his hand  the table trembled in the silence that followed   she had never seen him softened  and was much distressed  he knew her to be so  without looking at her  and said    pray forgive me  miss manette  i break down before the knowledge of what i want to say to you  will you hear me     if it will do you any good  mr  carton  if it would make you happier  it would make me very glad     god bless you for your sweet compassion    he unshaded his face after a little while  and spoke steadily    don t be afraid to hear me  don t shrink from anything i say  i am like one who died young  all my life might have been     no  mr  carton  i am sure that the best part of it might still be  i am sure that you might be much  much worthier of yourself     say of you  miss manette  and although i know better  although in the mystery of my own wretched heart i know better  i shall never forget it    she was pale and trembling  he came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden    if it had been possible  miss manette  that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourself  flung away  wasted  drunken  poor creature of misuse as you know him to be  he would have been conscious this day and hour  in spite of his happiness  that he would bring you to misery  bring you to sorrow and repentance  blight you  disgrace you  pull you down with him  i know very well that you can have no tenderness for me  i ask for none  i am even thankful that it cannot be     without it  can i not save you  mr  carton  can i not recall you  forgive me again   to a better course  can i in no way repay your confidence  i know this is a confidence   she modestly said  after a little hesitation  and in earnest tears   i know you would say this to no one else  can i turn it to no good account for yourself  mr  carton    he shook his head    to none  no  miss manette  to none  if you will hear me through a very little more  all you can ever do for me is done  i wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul  in my degradation i have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father  and of this home made such a home by you  has stirred old shadows that i thought had died out of me  since i knew you  i have been troubled by a remorse that i thought would never reproach me again  and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward  that i thought were silent for ever  i have had unformed ideas of striving afresh  beginning anew  shaking off sloth and sensuality  and fighting out the abandoned fight  a dream  all a dream  that ends in nothing  and leaves the sleeper where he lay down  but i wish you to know that you inspired it     will nothing of it remain  o mr  carton  think again  try again     no  miss manette  all through it  i have known myself to be quite undeserving  and yet i have had the weakness  and have still the weakness  to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me  heap of ashes that i am  into fire  a fire  however  inseparable in its nature from myself  quickening nothing  lighting nothing  doing no service  idly burning away     since it is my misfortune  mr  carton  to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me      don t say that  miss manette  for you would have reclaimed me  if anything could  you will not be the cause of my becoming worse     since the state of your mind that you describe  is  at all events  attributable to some influence of mine  this is what i mean  if i can make it plain  can i use no influence to serve you  have i no power for good  with you  at all     the utmost good that i am capable of now  miss manette  i have come here to realise  let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life  the remembrance that i opened my heart to you  last of all the world  and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity     which i entreated you to believe  again and again  most fervently  with all my heart  was capable of better things  mr  carton     entreat me to believe it no more  miss manette  i have proved myself  and i know better  i distress you  i draw fast to an end  will you let me believe  when i recall this day  that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast  and that it lies there alone  and will be shared by no one     if that will be a consolation to you  yes     not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you     mr  carton   she answered  after an agitated pause   the secret is yours  not mine  and i promise to respect it     thank you  and again  god bless you    he put her hand to his lips  and moved towards the door    be under no apprehension  miss manette  of my ever resuming this conversation by so much as a passing word  i will never refer to it again  if i were dead  that could not be surer than it is henceforth  in the hour of my death  i shall hold sacred the one good remembrance  and shall thank and bless you for it  that my last avowal of myself was made to you  and that my name  and faults  and miseries were gently carried in your heart  may it otherwise be light and happy    he was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be  and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away  and how much he every day kept down and perverted  that lucie manette wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her    be comforted   he said   i am not worth such feeling  miss manette  an hour or two hence  and the low companions and low habits that i scorn but yield to  will render me less worth such tears as those  than any wretch who creeps along the streets  be comforted  but  within myself  i shall always be  towards you  what i am now  though outwardly i shall be what you have heretofore seen me  the last supplication but one i make to you  is  that you will believe this of me     i will  mr  carton     my last supplication of all  is this  and with it  i will relieve you of a visitor with whom i well know you have nothing in unison  and between whom and you there is an impassable space  it is useless to say it  i know  but it rises out of my soul  for you  and for any dear to you  i would do anything  if my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it  i would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you  try to hold me in your mind  at some quiet times  as ardent and sincere in this one thing  the time will come  the time will not be long in coming  when new ties will be formed about you  ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn  the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you  o miss manette  when the little picture of a happy father s face looks up in yours  when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet  think now and then that there is a man who would give his life  to keep a life you love beside you    he said   farewell   said a last  god bless you   and left her      xiv  the honest tradesman   to the eyes of mr  jeremiah cruncher  sitting on his stool in fleet street with his grisly urchin beside him  a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented  who could sit upon anything in fleet street during the busy hours of the day  and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions  one ever tending westward with the sun  the other ever tending eastward from the sun  both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down   with his straw in his mouth  mr  cruncher sat watching the two streams  like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream  saving that jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry  nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind  since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women  mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life  from tellson s side of the tides to the opposite shore  brief as such companionship was in every separate instance  mr  cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health  and it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose  that he recruited his finances  as just now observed   time was  when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place  and mused in the sight of men  mr  cruncher  sitting on a stool in a public place  but not being a poet  mused as little as possible  and looked about him   it fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few  and belated women few  and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that mrs  cruncher must have been  flopping  in some pointed manner  when an unusual concourse pouring down fleet street westward  attracted his attention  looking that way  mr  cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along  and that there was popular objection to this funeral  which engendered uproar    young jerry   said mr  cruncher  turning to his offspring   it s a buryin      hooroar  father   cried young jerry   the young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance  the elder gentleman took the cry so ill  that he watched his opportunity  and smote the young gentleman on the ear    what d ye mean  what are you hooroaring at  what do you want to conwey to your own father  you young rip  this boy is a getting too many for me   said mr  cruncher  surveying him   him and his hooroars  don t let me hear no more of you  or you shall feel some more of me  d ye hear     i warn t doing no harm   young jerry protested  rubbing his cheek    drop it then   said mr  cruncher   i won t have none of your no harms  get a top of that there seat  and look at the crowd    his son obeyed  and the crowd approached  they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach  in which mourning coach there was only one mourner  dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position  the position appeared by no means to please him  however  with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach  deriding him  making grimaces at him  and incessantly groaning and calling out   yah  spies  tst  yaha  spies    with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat   funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for mr  cruncher  he always pricked up his senses  and became excited  when a funeral passed tellson s  naturally  therefore  a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly  and he asked of the first man who ran against him    what is it  brother  what s it about     i don t know   said the man   spies  yaha  tst  spies    he asked another man   who is it     i don t know   returned the man  clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless  and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour   spies  yaha  tst  tst  spi  ies    at length  a person better informed on the merits of the case  tumbled against him  and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one roger cly    was he a spy   asked mr  cruncher    old bailey spy   returned his informant   yaha  tst  yah  old bailey spi  i  ies     why  to be sure   exclaimed jerry  recalling the trial at which he had assisted   i ve seen him  dead  is he     dead as mutton   returned the other   and can t be too dead  have  em out  there  spies  pull  em out  there  spies    the idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea  that the crowd caught it up with eagerness  and loudly repeating the suggestion to have  em out  and to pull  em out  mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop  on the crowd s opening the coach doors  the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands for a moment  but he was so alert  and made such good use of his time  that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye street  after shedding his cloak  hat  long hatband  white pocket handkerchief  and other symbolical tears   these  the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment  while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops  for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing  and was a monster much dreaded  they had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out  when some brighter genius proposed instead  its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing  practical suggestions being much needed  this suggestion  too  was received with acclamation  and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out  while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it  among the first of these volunteers was jerry cruncher himself  who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of tellson s  in the further corner of the mourning coach   the officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies  but  the river being alarmingly near  and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason  the protest was faint and brief  the remodelled procession started  with a chimney sweep driving the hearse  advised by the regular driver  who was perched beside him  under close inspection  for the purpose  and with a pieman  also attended by his cabinet minister  driving the mourning coach  a bear leader  a popular street character of the time  was impressed as an additional ornament  before the cavalcade had gone far down the strand  and his bear  who was black and very mangy  gave quite an undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked   thus  with beer drinking  pipe smoking  song roaring  and infinite caricaturing of woe  the disorderly procession went its way  recruiting at every step  and all the shops shutting up before it  its destination was the old church of saint pancras  far off in the fields  it got there in course of time  insisted on pouring into the burial ground  finally  accomplished the interment of the deceased roger cly in its own way  and highly to its own satisfaction   the dead man disposed of  and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself  another brighter genius  or perhaps the same  conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers by  as old bailey spies  and wreaking vengeance on them  chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the old bailey in their lives  in the realisation of this fancy  and they were roughly hustled and maltreated  the transition to the sport of window breaking  and thence to the plundering of public houses  was easy and natural  at last  after several hours  when sundry summer houses had been pulled down  and some area railings had been torn up  to arm the more belligerent spirits  a rumour got about that the guards were coming  before this rumour  the crowd gradually melted away  and perhaps the guards came  and perhaps they never came  and this was the usual progress of a mob   mr  cruncher did not assist at the closing sports  but had remained behind in the churchyard  to confer and condole with the undertakers  the place had a soothing influence on him  he procured a pipe from a neighbouring public house  and smoked it  looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot    jerry   said mr  cruncher  apostrophising himself in his usual way   you see that there cly that day  and you see with your own eyes that he was a young  un and a straight made  un    having smoked his pipe out  and ruminated a little longer  he turned himself about  that he might appear  before the hour of closing  on his station at tellson s  whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver  or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss  or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man  is not so much to the purpose  as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser  a distinguished surgeon  on his way back   young jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest  and reported no job in his absence  the bank closed  the ancient clerks came out  the usual watch was set  and mr  cruncher and his son went home to tea    now  i tell you where it is   said mr  cruncher to his wife  on entering   if  as a honest tradesman  my wenturs goes wrong to night  i shall make sure that you ve been praying again me  and i shall work you for it just the same as if i seen you do it    the dejected mrs  cruncher shook her head    why  you re at it afore my face   said mr  cruncher  with signs of angry apprehension    i am saying nothing     well  then  don t meditate nothing  you might as well flop as meditate  you may as well go again me one way as another  drop it altogether     yes  jerry     yes  jerry   repeated mr  cruncher sitting down to tea   ah  it is yes  jerry  that s about it  you may say yes  jerry    mr  cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations  but made use of them  as people not unfrequently do  to express general ironical dissatisfaction    you and your yes  jerry   said mr  cruncher  taking a bite out of his bread and butter  and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer   ah  i think so  i believe you     you are going out to night   asked his decent wife  when he took another bite    yes  i am     may i go with you  father   asked his son  briskly    no  you mayn t  i m a going  as your mother knows  a fishing  that s where i m going to  going a fishing     your fishing rod gets rayther rusty  don t it  father     never you mind     shall you bring any fish home  father     if i don t  you ll have short commons  to morrow   returned that gentleman  shaking his head   that s questions enough for you  i ain t a going out  till you ve been long abed    he devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on mrs  cruncher  and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage  with this view  he urged his son to hold her in conversation also  and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her  rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections  the devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife  it was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story    and mind you   said mr  cruncher   no games to morrow  if i  as a honest tradesman  succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two  none of your not touching of it  and sticking to bread  if i  as a honest tradesman  am able to provide a little beer  none of your declaring on water  when you go to rome  do as rome does  rome will be a ugly customer to you  if you don t  i m your rome  you know    then he began grumbling again    with your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink  i don t know how scarce you mayn t make the wittles and drink here  by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct  look at your boy  he is your n  ain t he  he s as thin as a lath  do you call yourself a mother  and not know that a mother s first duty is to blow her boy out    this touched young jerry on a tender place  who adjured his mother to perform her first duty  and  whatever else she did or neglected  above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent   thus the evening wore away with the cruncher family  until young jerry was ordered to bed  and his mother  laid under similar injunctions  obeyed them  mr  cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes  and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o clock  towards that small and ghostly hour  he rose up from his chair  took a key out of his pocket  opened a locked cupboard  and brought forth a sack  a crowbar of convenient size  a rope and chain  and other fishing tackle of that nature  disposing these articles about him in skilful manner  he bestowed a parting defiance on mrs  cruncher  extinguished the light  and went out   young jerry  who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed  was not long after his father  under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room  followed down the stairs  followed down the court  followed out into the streets  he was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again  for it was full of lodgers  and the door stood ajar all night   impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father s honest calling  young jerry  keeping as close to house fronts  walls  and doorways  as his eyes were close to one another  held his honoured parent in view  the honoured parent steering northward  had not gone far  when he was joined by another disciple of izaak walton  and the two trudged on together   within half an hour from the first starting  they were beyond the winking lamps  and the more than winking watchmen  and were out upon a lonely road  another fisherman was picked up here  and that so silently  that if young jerry had been superstitious  he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have  all of a sudden  split himself into two   the three went on  and young jerry went on  until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road  upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall  surmounted by an iron railing  in the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road  and up a blind lane  of which the wall  there  risen to some eight or ten feet high  formed one side  crouching down in a corner  peeping up the lane  the next object that young jerry saw  was the form of his honoured parent  pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon  nimbly scaling an iron gate  he was soon over  and then the second fisherman got over  and then the third  they all dropped softly on the ground within the gate  and lay there a little  listening perhaps  then  they moved away on their hands and knees   it was now young jerry s turn to approach the gate  which he did  holding his breath  crouching down again in a corner there  and looking in  he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass  and all the gravestones in the churchyard  it was a large churchyard that they were in  looking on like ghosts in white  while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant  they did not creep far  before they stopped and stood upright  and then they began to fish   they fished with a spade  at first  presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew  whatever tools they worked with  they worked hard  until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified young jerry  that he made off  with his hair as stiff as his father s   but  his long cherished desire to know more about these matters  not only stopped him in his running away  but lured him back again  they were still fishing perseveringly  when he peeped in at the gate for the second time  but  now they seemed to have got a bite  there was a screwing and complaining sound down below  and their bent figures were strained  as if by a weight  by slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it  and came to the surface  young jerry very well knew what it would be  but  when he saw it  and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open  he was so frightened  being new to the sight  that he made off again  and never stopped until he had run a mile or more   he would not have stopped then  for anything less necessary than breath  it being a spectral sort of race that he ran  and one highly desirable to get to the end of  he had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him  and  pictured as hopping on behind him  bolt upright  upon its narrow end  always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side  perhaps taking his arm  it was a pursuer to shun  it was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too  for  while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful  he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys  fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy s kite without tail and wings  it hid in doorways too  rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors  and drawing them up to its ears  as if it were laughing  it got into shadows on the road  and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up  all this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him  so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead  and even then it would not leave him  but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair  scrambled into bed with him  and bumped down  dead and heavy  on his breast when he fell asleep   from his oppressed slumber  young jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise  by the presence of his father in the family room  something had gone wrong with him  at least  so young jerry inferred  from the circumstance of his holding mrs  cruncher by the ears  and knocking the back of her head against the head board of the bed    i told you i would   said mr  cruncher   and i did     jerry  jerry  jerry   his wife implored    you oppose yourself to the profit of the business   said jerry   and me and my partners suffer  you was to honour and obey  why the devil don t you     i try to be a good wife  jerry   the poor woman protested  with tears    is it being a good wife to oppose your husband s business  is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business  is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business     you hadn t taken to the dreadful business then  jerry     it s enough for you   retorted mr  cruncher   to be the wife of a honest tradesman  and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn t  a honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether  call yourself a religious woman  if you re a religious woman  give me a irreligious one  you have no more nat ral sense of duty than the bed of this here thames river has of a pile  and similarly it must be knocked into you    the altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice  and terminated in the honest tradesman s kicking off his clay soiled boots  and lying down at his length on the floor  after taking a timid peep at him lying on his back  with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow  his son lay down too  and fell asleep again   there was no fish for breakfast  and not much of anything else  mr  cruncher was out of spirits  and out of temper  and kept an iron pot lid by him as a projectile for the correction of mrs  cruncher  in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying grace  he was brushed and washed at the usual hour  and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling   young jerry  walking with the stool under his arm at his father s side along sunny and crowded fleet street  was a very different young jerry from him of the previous night  running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer  his cunning was fresh with the day  and his qualms were gone with the night  in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in fleet street and the city of london  that fine morning    father   said young jerry  as they walked along  taking care to keep at arm s length and to have the stool well between them   what s a resurrection man    mr  cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered   how should i know     i thought you knowed everything  father   said the artless boy    hem  well   returned mr  cruncher  going on again  and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play   he s a tradesman     what s his goods  father   asked the brisk young jerry    his goods   said mr  cruncher  after turning it over in his mind   is a branch of scientific goods     persons  bodies  ain t it  father   asked the lively boy    i believe it is something of that sort   said mr  cruncher    oh  father  i should so like to be a resurrection man when i m quite growed up    mr  cruncher was soothed  but shook his head in a dubious and moral way   it depends upon how you dewelop your talents  be careful to dewelop your talents  and never to say no more than you can help to nobody  and there s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for   as young jerry  thus encouraged  went on a few yards in advance  to plant the stool in the shadow of the bar  mr  cruncher added to himself   jerry  you honest tradesman  there s hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you  and a recompense to you for his mother       xv  knitting   there had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine shop of monsieur defarge  as early as six o clock in the morning  sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within  bending over measures of wine  monsieur defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times  but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time  a sour wine  moreover  or a souring  for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy  no vivacious bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of monsieur defarge  but  a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark  lay hidden in the dregs of it   this had been the third morning in succession  on which there had been early drinking at the wine shop of monsieur defarge  it had begun on monday  and here was wednesday come  there had been more of early brooding than drinking  for  many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door  who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls  these were to the full as interested in the place  however  as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine  and they glided from seat to seat  and from corner to corner  swallowing talk in lieu of drink  with greedy looks   notwithstanding an unusual flow of company  the master of the wine shop was not visible  he was not missed  for  nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him  nobody asked for him  nobody wondered to see only madame defarge in her seat  presiding over the distribution of wine  with a bowl of battered small coins before her  as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come   a suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind  were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine shop  as they looked in at every place  high and low  from the king s palace to the criminal s gaol  games at cards languished  players at dominoes musingly built towers with them  drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine  madame defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick  and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off   thus  saint antoine in this vinous feature of his  until midday  it was high noontide  when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps  of whom  one was monsieur defarge  the other a mender of roads in a blue cap  all adust and athirst  the two entered the wine shop  their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of saint antoine  fast spreading as they came along  which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows  yet  no one had followed them  and no man spoke when they entered the wine shop  though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them    good day  gentlemen   said monsieur defarge   it may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue  it elicited an answering chorus of  good day     it is bad weather  gentlemen   said defarge  shaking his head   upon which  every man looked at his neighbour  and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent  except one man  who got up and went out    my wife   said defarge aloud  addressing madame defarge   i have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads  called jacques  i met him  by accident  a day and half s journey out of paris  he is a good child  this mender of roads  called jacques  give him to drink  my wife    a second man got up and went out  madame defarge set wine before the mender of roads called jacques  who doffed his blue cap to the company  and drank  in the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread  he ate of this between whiles  and sat munching and drinking near madame defarge s counter  a third man got up and went out   defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine  but  he took less than was given to the stranger  as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity  and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast  he looked at no one present  and no one now looked at him  not even madame defarge  who had taken up her knitting  and was at work    have you finished your repast  friend   he asked  in due season    yes  thank you     come  then  you shall see the apartment that i told you you could occupy  it will suit you to a marvel    out of the wine shop into the street  out of the street into a courtyard  out of the courtyard up a steep staircase  out of the staircase into a garret  formerly the garret where a white haired man sat on a low bench  stooping forward and very busy  making shoes   no white haired man was there now  but  the three men were there who had gone out of the wine shop singly  and between them and the white haired man afar off  was the one small link  that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall   defarge closed the door carefully  and spoke in a subdued voice    jacques one  jacques two  jacques three  this is the witness encountered by appointment  by me  jacques four  he will tell you all  speak  jacques five    the mender of roads  blue cap in hand  wiped his swarthy forehead with it  and said   where shall i commence  monsieur     commence   was monsieur defarge s not unreasonable reply   at the commencement     i saw him then  messieurs   began the mender of roads   a year ago this running summer  underneath the carriage of the marquis  hanging by the chain  behold the manner of it  i leaving my work on the road  the sun going to bed  the carriage of the marquis slowly ascending the hill  he hanging by the chain  like this    again the mender of roads went through the whole performance  in which he ought to have been perfect by that time  seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year   jacques one struck in  and asked if he had ever seen the man before    never   answered the mender of roads  recovering his perpendicular   jacques three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then    by his tall figure   said the mender of roads  softly  and with his finger at his nose   when monsieur the marquis demands that evening   say  what is he like   i make response   tall as a spectre      you should have said  short as a dwarf   returned jacques two    but what did i know  the deed was not then accomplished  neither did he confide in me  observe  under those circumstances even  i do not offer my testimony  monsieur the marquis indicates me with his finger  standing near our little fountain  and says   to me  bring that rascal   my faith  messieurs  i offer nothing     he is right there  jacques   murmured defarge  to him who had interrupted   go on     good   said the mender of roads  with an air of mystery   the tall man is lost  and he is sought  how many months  nine  ten  eleven     no matter  the number   said defarge   he is well hidden  but at last he is unluckily found  go on     i am again at work upon the hill side  and the sun is again about to go to bed  i am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below  where it is already dark  when i raise my eyes  and see coming over the hill six soldiers  in the midst of them is a tall man with his arms bound  tied to his sides  like this    with the aid of his indispensable cap  he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips  with cords that were knotted behind him    i stand aside  messieurs  by my heap of stones  to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass  for it is a solitary road  that  where any spectacle is well worth looking at   and at first  as they approach  i see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound  and that they are almost black to my sight  except on the side of the sun going to bed  where they have a red edge  messieurs  also  i see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road  and are on the hill above it  and are like the shadows of giants  also  i see that they are covered with dust  and that the dust moves with them as they come  tramp  tramp  but when they advance quite near to me  i recognise the tall man  and he recognises me  ah  but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hill side once again  as on the evening when he and i first encountered  close to the same spot    he described it as if he were there  and it was evident that he saw it vividly  perhaps he had not seen much in his life    i do not show the soldiers that i recognise the tall man  he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me  we do it  and we know it  with our eyes   come on   says the chief of that company  pointing to the village   bring him fast to his tomb   and they bring him faster  i follow  his arms are swelled because of being bound so tight  his wooden shoes are large and clumsy  and he is lame  because he is lame  and consequently slow  they drive him with their guns  like this    he imitated the action of a man s being impelled forward by the butt ends of muskets    as they descend the hill like madmen running a race  he falls  they laugh and pick him up again  his face is bleeding and covered with dust  but he cannot touch it  thereupon they laugh again  they bring him into the village  all the village runs to look  they take him past the mill  and up to the prison  all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night  and swallow him  like this    he opened his mouth as wide as he could  and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth  observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again  defarge said   go on  jacques     all the village   pursued the mender of roads  on tiptoe and in a low voice   withdraws  all the village whispers by the fountain  all the village sleeps  all the village dreams of that unhappy one  within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag  and never to come out of it  except to perish  in the morning  with my tools upon my shoulder  eating my morsel of black bread as i go  i make a circuit by the prison  on my way to my work  there i see him  high up  behind the bars of a lofty iron cage  bloody and dusty as last night  looking through  he has no hand free  to wave to me  i dare not call to him  he regards me like a dead man    defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another  the looks of all of them were dark  repressed  and revengeful  as they listened to the countryman s story  the manner of all of them  while it was secret  was authoritative too  they had the air of a rough tribunal  jacques one and two sitting on the old pallet bed  each with his chin resting on his hand  and his eyes intent on the road mender  jacques three  equally intent  on one knee behind them  with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose  defarge standing between them and the narrator  whom he had stationed in the light of the window  by turns looking from him to them  and from them to him    go on  jacques   said defarge    he remains up there in his iron cage some days  the village looks at him by stealth  for it is afraid  but it always looks up  from a distance  at the prison on the crag  and in the evening  when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain  all faces are turned towards the prison  formerly  they were turned towards the posting house  now  they are turned towards the prison  they whisper at the fountain  that although condemned to death he will not be executed  they say that petitions have been presented in paris  showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child  they say that a petition has been presented to the king himself  what do i know  it is possible  perhaps yes  perhaps no     listen then  jacques   number one of that name sternly interposed   know that a petition was presented to the king and queen  all here  yourself excepted  saw the king take it  in his carriage in the street  sitting beside the queen  it is defarge whom you see here  who  at the hazard of his life  darted out before the horses  with the petition in his hand     and once again listen  jacques   said the kneeling number three  his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves  with a strikingly greedy air  as if he hungered for something  that was neither food nor drink   the guard  horse and foot  surrounded the petitioner  and struck him blows  you hear     i hear  messieurs     go on then   said defarge    again  on the other hand  they whisper at the fountain   resumed the countryman   that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot  and that he will very certainly be executed  they even whisper that because he has slain monseigneur  and because monseigneur was the father of his tenants  serfs  what you will  he will be executed as a parricide  one old man says at the fountain  that his right hand  armed with the knife  will be burnt off before his face  that  into wounds which will be made in his arms  his breast  and his legs  there will be poured boiling oil  melted lead  hot resin  wax  and sulphur  finally  that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses  that old man says  all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late king  louis fifteen  but how do i know if he lies  i am not a scholar     listen once again then  jacques   said the man with the restless hand and the craving air   the name of that prisoner was damiens  and it was all done in open day  in the open streets of this city of paris  and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done  than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion  who were full of eager attention to the last  to the last  jacques  prolonged until nightfall  when he had lost two legs and an arm  and still breathed  and it was done  why  how old are you     thirty five   said the mender of roads  who looked sixty    it was done when you were more than ten years old  you might have seen it     enough   said defarge  with grim impatience   long live the devil  go on     well  some whisper this  some whisper that  they speak of nothing else  even the fountain appears to fall to that tune  at length  on sunday night when all the village is asleep  come soldiers  winding down from the prison  and their guns ring on the stones of the little street  workmen dig  workmen hammer  soldiers laugh and sing  in the morning  by the fountain  there is raised a gallows forty feet high  poisoning the water    the mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling  and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky    all work is stopped  all assemble there  nobody leads the cows out  the cows are there with the rest  at midday  the roll of drums  soldiers have marched into the prison in the night  and he is in the midst of many soldiers  he is bound as before  and in his mouth there is a gag  tied so  with a tight string  making him look almost as if he laughed   he suggested it  by creasing his face with his two thumbs  from the corners of his mouth to his ears   on the top of the gallows is fixed the knife  blade upwards  with its point in the air  he is hanged there forty feet high  and is left hanging  poisoning the water    they looked at one another  as he used his blue cap to wipe his face  on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle    it is frightful  messieurs  how can the women and the children draw water  who can gossip of an evening  under that shadow  under it  have i said  when i left the village  monday evening as the sun was going to bed  and looked back from the hill  the shadow struck across the church  across the mill  across the prison  seemed to strike across the earth  messieurs  to where the sky rests upon it    the hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three  and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him    that s all  messieurs  i left at sunset  as i had been warned to do   and i walked on  that night and half next day  until i met  as i was warned i should  this comrade  with him  i came on  now riding and now walking  through the rest of yesterday and through last night  and here you see me    after a gloomy silence  the first jacques said   good  you have acted and recounted faithfully  will you wait for us a little  outside the door     very willingly   said the mender of roads  whom defarge escorted to the top of the stairs  and  leaving seated there  returned   the three had risen  and their heads were together when he came back to the garret    how say you  jacques   demanded number one   to be registered     to be registered  as doomed to destruction   returned defarge    magnificent   croaked the man with the craving    the chateau  and all the race   inquired the first    the chateau and all the race   returned defarge   extermination    the hungry man repeated  in a rapturous croak   magnificent   and began gnawing another finger    are you sure   asked jacques two  of defarge   that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register  without doubt it is safe  for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it  but shall we always be able to decipher it  or  i ought to say  will she     jacques   returned defarge  drawing himself up   if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone  she would not lose a word of it  not a syllable of it  knitted  in her own stitches and her own symbols  it will always be as plain to her as the sun  confide in madame defarge  it would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives  to erase himself from existence  than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of madame defarge    there was a murmur of confidence and approval  and then the man who hungered  asked   is this rustic to be sent back soon  i hope so  he is very simple  is he not a little dangerous     he knows nothing   said defarge   at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height  i charge myself with him  let him remain with me  i will take care of him  and set him on his road  he wishes to see the fine world  the king  the queen  and court  let him see them on sunday     what   exclaimed the hungry man  staring   is it a good sign  that he wishes to see royalty and nobility     jacques   said defarge   judiciously show a cat milk  if you wish her to thirst for it  judiciously show a dog his natural prey  if you wish him to bring it down one day    nothing more was said  and the mender of roads  being found already dozing on the topmost stair  was advised to lay himself down on the pallet bed and take some rest  he needed no persuasion  and was soon asleep   worse quarters than defarge s wine shop  could easily have been found in paris for a provincial slave of that degree  saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted  his life was very new and agreeable  but  madame sat all day at her counter  so expressly unconscious of him  and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface  that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her  for  he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next  and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim  she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out   therefore  when sunday came  the mender of roads was not enchanted  though he said he was  to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to versailles  it was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there  in a public conveyance  it was additionally disconcerting yet  to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon  still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the king and queen    you work hard  madame   said a man near her    yes   answered madame defarge   i have a good deal to do     what do you make  madame     many things     for instance      for instance   returned madame defarge  composedly   shrouds    the man moved a little further away  as soon as he could  and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap  feeling it mightily close and oppressive  if he needed a king and queen to restore him  he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand  for  soon the large faced king and the fair faced queen came in their golden coach  attended by the shining bull s eye of their court  a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords  and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes  the mender of roads bathed himself  so much to his temporary intoxication  that he cried long live the king  long live the queen  long live everybody and everything  as if he had never heard of ubiquitous jacques in his time  then  there were gardens  courtyards  terraces  fountains  green banks  more king and queen  more bull s eye  more lords and ladies  more long live they all  until he absolutely wept with sentiment  during the whole of this scene  which lasted some three hours  he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company  and throughout defarge held him by the collar  as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces    bravo   said defarge  clapping him on the back when it was over  like a patron   you are a good boy    the mender of roads was now coming to himself  and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations  but no    you are the fellow we want   said defarge  in his ear   you make these fools believe that it will last for ever  then  they are the more insolent  and it is the nearer ended     hey   cried the mender of roads  reflectively   that s true     these fools know nothing  while they despise your breath  and would stop it for ever and ever  in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs  they only know what your breath tells them  let it deceive them  then  a little longer  it cannot deceive them too much    madame defarge looked superciliously at the client  and nodded in confirmation    as to you   said she   you would shout and shed tears for anything  if it made a show and a noise  say  would you not     truly  madame  i think so  for the moment     if you were shown a great heap of dolls  and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage  you would pick out the richest and gayest  say  would you not     truly yes  madame     yes  and if you were shown a flock of birds  unable to fly  and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage  you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers  would you not     it is true  madame     you have seen both dolls and birds to day   said madame defarge  with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent   now  go home       xvi  still knitting   madame defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of saint antoine  while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness  and through the dust  and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside  slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of monsieur the marquis  now in his grave  listened to the whispering trees  such ample leisure had the stone faces  now  for listening to the trees and to the fountain  that the few village scarecrows who  in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn  strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase  had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered  a rumour just lived in the village  had a faint and bare existence there  as its people had  that when the knife struck home  the faces changed  from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain  also  that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain  they changed again  and bore a cruel look of being avenged  which they would henceforth bear for ever  in the stone face over the great window of the bed chamber where the murder was done  two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose  which everybody recognised  and which nobody had seen of old  and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at monsieur the marquis petrified  a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute  before they all started away among the moss and leaves  like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there   chateau and hut  stone face and dangling figure  the red stain on the stone floor  and the pure water in the village well  thousands of acres of land  a whole province of france  all france itself  lay under the night sky  concentrated into a faint hair breadth line  so does a whole world  with all its greatnesses and littlenesses  lie in a twinkling star  and as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition  so  sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours  every thought and act  every vice and virtue  of every responsible creature on it   the defarges  husband and wife  came lumbering under the starlight  in their public vehicle  to that gate of paris whereunto their journey naturally tended  there was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse  and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry  monsieur defarge alighted  knowing one or two of the soldiery there  and one of the police  the latter he was intimate with  and affectionately embraced   when saint antoine had again enfolded the defarges in his dusky wings  and they  having finally alighted near the saint s boundaries  were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets  madame defarge spoke to her husband    say then  my friend  what did jacques of the police tell thee     very little to night  but all he knows  there is another spy commissioned for our quarter  there may be many more  for all that he can say  but he knows of one     eh well   said madame defarge  raising her eyebrows with a cool business air   it is necessary to register him  how do they call that man     he is english     so much the better  his name     barsad   said defarge  making it french by pronunciation  but  he had been so careful to get it accurately  that he then spelt it with perfect correctness    barsad   repeated madame   good  christian name     john     john barsad   repeated madame  after murmuring it once to herself   good  his appearance  is it known     age  about forty years  height  about five feet nine  black hair  complexion dark  generally  rather handsome visage  eyes dark  face thin  long  and sallow  nose aquiline  but not straight  having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek  expression  therefore  sinister     eh my faith  it is a portrait   said madame  laughing   he shall be registered to morrow    they turned into the wine shop  which was closed  for it was midnight   and where madame defarge immediately took her post at her desk  counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence  examined the stock  went through the entries in the book  made other entries of her own  checked the serving man in every possible way  and finally dismissed him to bed  then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time  and began knotting them up in her handkerchief  in a chain of separate knots  for safe keeping through the night  all this while  defarge  with his pipe in his mouth  walked up and down  complacently admiring  but never interfering  in which condition  indeed  as to the business and his domestic affairs  he walked up and down through life   the night was hot  and the shop  close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood  was ill smelling  monsieur defarge s olfactory sense was by no means delicate  but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted  and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed  he whiffed the compound of scents away  as he put down his smoked out pipe    you are fatigued   said madame  raising her glance as she knotted the money   there are only the usual odours     i am a little tired   her husband acknowledged    you are a little depressed  too   said madame  whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts  but they had had a ray or two for him   oh  the men  the men     but my dear   began defarge    but my dear   repeated madame  nodding firmly   but my dear  you are faint of heart to night  my dear     well  then   said defarge  as if a thought were wrung out of his breast   it is a long time     it is a long time   repeated his wife   and when is it not a long time  vengeance and retribution require a long time  it is the rule     it does not take a long time to strike a man with lightning   said defarge    how long   demanded madame  composedly   does it take to make and store the lightning  tell me    defarge raised his head thoughtfully  as if there were something in that too    it does not take a long time   said madame   for an earthquake to swallow a town  eh well  tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake     a long time  i suppose   said defarge    but when it is ready  it takes place  and grinds to pieces everything before it  in the meantime  it is always preparing  though it is not seen or heard  that is your consolation  keep it    she tied a knot with flashing eyes  as if it throttled a foe    i tell thee   said madame  extending her right hand  for emphasis   that although it is a long time on the road  it is on the road and coming  i tell thee it never retreats  and never stops  i tell thee it is always advancing  look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know  consider the faces of all the world that we know  consider the rage and discontent to which the jacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour  can such things last  bah  i mock you     my brave wife   returned defarge  standing before her with his head a little bent  and his hands clasped at his back  like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist   i do not question all this  but it has lasted a long time  and it is possible  you know well  my wife  it is possible  that it may not come  during our lives     eh well  how then   demanded madame  tying another knot  as if there were another enemy strangled    well   said defarge  with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug   we shall not see the triumph     we shall have helped it   returned madame  with her extended hand in strong action   nothing that we do  is done in vain  i believe  with all my soul  that we shall see the triumph  but even if not  even if i knew certainly not  show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant  and still i would     then madame  with her teeth set  tied a very terrible knot indeed    hold   cried defarge  reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice   i too  my dear  will stop at nothing     yes  but it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity  to sustain you  sustain yourself without that  when the time comes  let loose a tiger and a devil  but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chained  not shown  yet always ready    madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out  and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner  and observing that it was time to go to bed   next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wine shop  knitting away assiduously  a rose lay beside her  and if she now and then glanced at the flower  it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air  there were a few customers  drinking or not drinking  standing or seated  sprinkled about  the day was very hot  and heaps of flies  who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame  fell dead at the bottom  their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading  who looked at them in the coolest manner  as if they themselves were elephants  or something as far removed   until they met the same fate  curious to consider how heedless flies are   perhaps they thought as much at court that sunny summer day   a figure entering at the door threw a shadow on madame defarge which she felt to be a new one  she laid down her knitting  and began to pin her rose in her head dress  before she looked at the figure   it was curious  the moment madame defarge took up the rose  the customers ceased talking  and began gradually to drop out of the wine shop    good day  madame   said the new comer    good day  monsieur    she said it aloud  but added to herself  as she resumed her knitting   hah  good day  age about forty  height about five feet nine  black hair  generally rather handsome visage  complexion dark  eyes dark  thin  long and sallow face  aquiline nose but not straight  having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression  good day  one and all     have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac  and a mouthful of cool fresh water  madame    madame complied with a polite air    marvellous cognac this  madame    it was the first time it had ever been so complimented  and madame defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better  she said  however  that the cognac was flattered  and took up her knitting  the visitor watched her fingers for a few moments  and took the opportunity of observing the place in general    you knit with great skill  madame     i am accustomed to it     a pretty pattern too     you think so   said madame  looking at him with a smile    decidedly  may one ask what it is for     pastime   said madame  still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly    not for use     that depends  i may find a use for it one day  if i do  well   said madame  drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry   i ll use it    it was remarkable  but  the taste of saint antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head dress of madame defarge  two men had entered separately  and had been about to order drink  when  catching sight of that novelty  they faltered  made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there  and went away  nor  of those who had been there when this visitor entered  was there one left  they had all dropped off  the spy had kept his eyes open  but had been able to detect no sign  they had lounged away in a poverty stricken  purposeless  accidental manner  quite natural and unimpeachable    john   thought madame  checking off her work as her fingers knitted  and her eyes looked at the stranger   stay long enough  and i shall knit  barsad  before you go     you have a husband  madame     i have     children     no children     business seems bad     business is very bad  the people are so poor     ah  the unfortunate  miserable people  so oppressed  too  as you say     as you say   madame retorted  correcting him  and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good    pardon me  certainly it was i who said so  but you naturally think so  of course     i think   returned madame  in a high voice   i and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine shop open  without thinking  all we think  here  is how to live  that is the subject we think of  and it gives us  from morning to night  enough to think about  without embarrassing our heads concerning others  i think for others  no  no    the spy  who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make  did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face  but  stood with an air of gossiping gallantry  leaning his elbow on madame defarge s little counter  and occasionally sipping his cognac    a bad business this  madame  of gaspard s execution  ah  the poor gaspard   with a sigh of great compassion    my faith   returned madame  coolly and lightly   if people use knives for such purposes  they have to pay for it  he knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was  he has paid the price     i believe   said the spy  dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence  and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face   i believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood  touching the poor fellow  between ourselves     is there   asked madame  vacantly    is there not       here is my husband   said madame defarge   as the keeper of the wine shop entered at the door  the spy saluted him by touching his hat  and saying  with an engaging smile   good day  jacques   defarge stopped short  and stared at him    good day  jacques   the spy repeated  with not quite so much confidence  or quite so easy a smile under the stare    you deceive yourself  monsieur   returned the keeper of the wine shop   you mistake me for another  that is not my name  i am ernest defarge     it is all the same   said the spy  airily  but discomfited too   good day     good day   answered defarge  drily    i was saying to madame  with whom i had the pleasure of chatting when you entered  that they tell me there is  and no wonder   much sympathy and anger in saint antoine  touching the unhappy fate of poor gaspard     no one has told me so   said defarge  shaking his head   i know nothing of it    having said it  he passed behind the little counter  and stood with his hand on the back of his wife s chair  looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed  and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction   the spy  well used to his business  did not change his unconscious attitude  but drained his little glass of cognac  took a sip of fresh water  and asked for another glass of cognac  madame defarge poured it out for him  took to her knitting again  and hummed a little song over it    you seem to know this quarter well  that is to say  better than i do    observed defarge    not at all  but i hope to know it better  i am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants     hah   muttered defarge    the pleasure of conversing with you  monsieur defarge  recalls to me    pursued the spy   that i have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name     indeed   said defarge  with much indifference    yes  indeed  when doctor manette was released  you  his old domestic  had the charge of him  i know  he was delivered to you  you see i am informed of the circumstances     such is the fact  certainly   said defarge  he had had it conveyed to him  in an accidental touch of his wife s elbow as she knitted and warbled  that he would do best to answer  but always with brevity    it was to you   said the spy   that his daughter came  and it was from your care that his daughter took him  accompanied by a neat brown monsieur  how is he called   in a little wig  lorry  of the bank of tellson and company  over to england     such is the fact   repeated defarge    very interesting remembrances   said the spy   i have known doctor manette and his daughter  in england     yes   said defarge    you don t hear much about them now   said the spy    no   said defarge    in effect   madame struck in  looking up from her work and her little song   we never hear about them  we received the news of their safe arrival  and perhaps another letter  or perhaps two  but  since then  they have gradually taken their road in life  we  ours  and we have held no correspondence     perfectly so  madame   replied the spy   she is going to be married     going   echoed madame   she was pretty enough to have been married long ago  you english are cold  it seems to me     oh  you know i am english     i perceive your tongue is   returned madame   and what the tongue is  i suppose the man is    he did not take the identification as a compliment  but he made the best of it  and turned it off with a laugh  after sipping his cognac to the end  he added    yes  miss manette is going to be married  but not to an englishman  to one who  like herself  is french by birth  and speaking of gaspard  ah  poor gaspard  it was cruel  cruel    it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of monsieur the marquis  for whom gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet  in other words  the present marquis  but he lives unknown in england  he is no marquis there  he is mr  charles darnay  d aulnais is the name of his mother s family    madame defarge knitted steadily  but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband  do what he would  behind the little counter  as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe  he was troubled  and his hand was not trustworthy  the spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it  or to record it in his mind   having made  at least  this one hit  whatever it might prove to be worth  and no customers coming in to help him to any other  mr  barsad paid for what he had drunk  and took his leave  taking occasion to say  in a genteel manner  before he departed  that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame defarge again  for some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of saint antoine  the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them  lest he should come back    can it be true   said defarge  in a low voice  looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair   what he has said of ma amselle manette     as he has said it   returned madame  lifting her eyebrows a little   it is probably false  but it may be true     if it is    defarge began  and stopped    if it is   repeated his wife      and if it does come  while we live to see it triumph  i hope  for her sake  destiny will keep her husband out of france     her husband s destiny   said madame defarge  with her usual composure   will take him where he is to go  and will lead him to the end that is to end him  that is all i know     but it is very strange  now  at least  is it not very strange   said defarge  rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it   that  after all our sympathy for monsieur her father  and herself  her husband s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment  by the side of that infernal dog s who has just left us     stranger things than that will happen when it does come   answered madame   i have them both here  of a certainty  and they are both here for their merits  that is enough    she rolled up her knitting when she had said those words  and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head  either saint antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone  or saint antoine was on the watch for its disappearance  howbeit  the saint took courage to lounge in  very shortly afterwards  and the wine shop recovered its habitual aspect   in the evening  at which season of all others saint antoine turned himself inside out  and sat on door steps and window ledges  and came to the corners of vile streets and courts  for a breath of air  madame defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group  a missionary  there were many like her  such as the world will do well never to breed again  all the women knitted  they knitted worthless things  but  the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking  the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus  if the bony fingers had been still  the stomachs would have been more famine pinched   but  as the fingers went  the eyes went  and the thoughts  and as madame defarge moved on from group to group  all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with  and left behind   her husband smoked at his door  looking after her with admiration   a great woman   said he   a strong woman  a grand woman  a frightfully grand woman    darkness closed around  and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the palace courtyard  as the women sat knitting  knitting  darkness encompassed them  another darkness was closing in as surely  when the church bells  then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over france  should be melted into thundering cannon  when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice  that night all potent as the voice of power and plenty  freedom and life  so much was closing in about the women who sat knitting  knitting  that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt  where they were to sit knitting  knitting  counting dropping heads      xvii  one night   never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in soho  than one memorable evening when the doctor and his daughter sat under the plane tree together  never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great london  than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree  and shone upon their faces through its leaves   lucie was to be married to morrow  she had reserved this last evening for her father  and they sat alone under the plane tree    you are happy  my dear father     quite  my child    they had said little  though they had been there a long time  when it was yet light enough to work and read  she had neither engaged herself in her usual work  nor had she read to him  she had employed herself in both ways  at his side under the tree  many and many a time  but  this time was not quite like any other  and nothing could make it so    and i am very happy to night  dear father  i am deeply happy in the love that heaven has so blessed  my love for charles  and charles s love for me  but  if my life were not to be still consecrated to you  or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us  even by the length of a few of these streets  i should be more unhappy and self reproachful now than i can tell you  even as it is     even as it was  she could not command her voice   in the sad moonlight  she clasped him by the neck  and laid her face upon his breast  in the moonlight which is always sad  as the light of the sun itself is  as the light called human life is  at its coming and its going    dearest dear  can you tell me  this last time  that you feel quite  quite sure  no new affections of mine  and no new duties of mine  will ever interpose between us  i know it well  but do you know it  in your own heart  do you feel quite certain    her father answered  with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed   quite sure  my darling  more than that   he added  as he tenderly kissed her   my future is far brighter  lucie  seen through your marriage  than it could have been  nay  than it ever was  without it     if i could hope that  my father       believe it  love  indeed it is so  consider how natural and how plain it is  my dear  that it should be so  you  devoted and young  cannot fully appreciate the anxiety i have felt that your life should not be wasted     she moved her hand towards his lips  but he took it in his  and repeated the word      wasted  my child  should not be wasted  struck aside from the natural order of things  for my sake  your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this  but  only ask yourself  how could my happiness be perfect  while yours was incomplete     if i had never seen charles  my father  i should have been quite happy with you    he smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without charles  having seen him  and replied    my child  you did see him  and it is charles  if it had not been charles  it would have been another  or  if it had been no other  i should have been the cause  and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself  and would have fallen on you    it was the first time  except at the trial  of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering  it gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears  and she remembered it long afterwards    see   said the doctor of beauvais  raising his hand towards the moon   i have looked at her from my prison window  when i could not bear her light  i have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what i had lost  that i have beaten my head against my prison walls  i have looked at her  in a state so dull and lethargic  that i have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines i could draw across her at the full  and the number of perpendicular lines with which i could intersect them   he added in his inward and pondering manner  as he looked at the moon   it was twenty either way  i remember  and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in    the strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time  deepened as he dwelt upon it  but  there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference  he only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over    i have looked at her  speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom i had been rent  whether it was alive  whether it had been born alive  or the poor mother s shock had killed it  whether it was a son who would some day avenge his father   there was a time in my imprisonment  when my desire for vengeance was unbearable   whether it was a son who would never know his father s story  who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father s having disappeared of his own will and act  whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman    she drew closer to him  and kissed his cheek and his hand    i have pictured my daughter  to myself  as perfectly forgetful of me  rather  altogether ignorant of me  and unconscious of me  i have cast up the years of her age  year after year  i have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate  i have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living  and in the next generation my place was a blank     my father  even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed  strikes to my heart as if i had been that child     you  lucie  it is out of the consolation and restoration you have brought to me  that these remembrances arise  and pass between us and the moon on this last night   what did i say just now     she knew nothing of you  she cared nothing for you     so  but on other moonlight nights  when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way  have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace  as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could  i have imagined her as coming to me in my cell  and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress  i have seen her image in the moonlight often  as i now see you  except that i never held her in my arms  it stood between the little grated window and the door  but  you understand that that was not the child i am speaking of     the figure was not  the  the  image  the fancy     no  that was another thing  it stood before my disturbed sense of sight  but it never moved  the phantom that my mind pursued  was another and more real child  of her outward appearance i know no more than that she was like her mother  the other had that likeness too  as you have  but was not the same  can you follow me  lucie  hardly  i think  i doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions    his collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold  as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition    in that more peaceful state  i have imagined her  in the moonlight  coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father  my picture was in her room  and i was in her prayers  her life was active  cheerful  useful  but my poor history pervaded it all     i was that child  my father  i was not half so good  but in my love that was i     and she showed me her children   said the doctor of beauvais   and they had heard of me  and had been taught to pity me  when they passed a prison of the state  they kept far from its frowning walls  and looked up at its bars  and spoke in whispers  she could never deliver me  i imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things  but then  blessed with the relief of tears  i fell upon my knees  and blessed her     i am that child  i hope  my father  o my dear  my dear  will you bless me as fervently to morrow     lucie  i recall these old troubles in the reason that i have to night for loving you better than words can tell  and thanking god for my great happiness  my thoughts  when they were wildest  never rose near the happiness that i have known with you  and that we have before us    he embraced her  solemnly commended her to heaven  and humbly thanked heaven for having bestowed her on him  by and bye  they went into the house   there was no one bidden to the marriage but mr  lorry  there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross  the marriage was to make no change in their place of residence  they had been able to extend it  by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger  and they desired nothing more   doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper  they were only three at table  and miss pross made the third  he regretted that charles was not there  was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away  and drank to him affectionately   so  the time came for him to bid lucie good night  and they separated  but  in the stillness of the third hour of the morning  lucie came downstairs again  and stole into his room  not free from unshaped fears  beforehand   all things  however  were in their places  all was quiet  and he lay asleep  his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow  and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet  she put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance  crept up to his bed  and put her lips to his  then  leaned over him  and looked at him   into his handsome face  the bitter waters of captivity had worn  but  he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong  that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep  a more remarkable face in its quiet  resolute  and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant  was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep  that night   she timidly laid her hand on his dear breast  and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be  and as his sorrows deserved  then  she withdrew her hand  and kissed his lips once more  and went away  so  the sunrise came  and the shadows of the leaves of the plane tree moved upon his face  as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him      xviii  nine days   the marriage day was shining brightly  and they were ready outside the closed door of the doctor s room  where he was speaking with charles darnay  they were ready to go to church  the beautiful bride  mr  lorry  and miss pross  to whom the event  through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable  would have been one of absolute bliss  but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother solomon should have been the bridegroom    and so   said mr  lorry  who could not sufficiently admire the bride  and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet  pretty dress   and so it was for this  my sweet lucie  that i brought you across the channel  such a baby  lord bless me  how little i thought what i was doing  how lightly i valued the obligation i was conferring on my friend mr  charles     you didn t mean it   remarked the matter of fact miss pross   and therefore how could you know it  nonsense     really  well  but don t cry   said the gentle mr  lorry    i am not crying   said miss pross   you are     i  my pross    by this time  mr  lorry dared to be pleasant with her  on occasion     you were  just now  i saw you do it  and i don t wonder at it  such a present of plate as you have made  em  is enough to bring tears into anybody s eyes  there s not a fork or a spoon in the collection   said miss pross   that i didn t cry over  last night after the box came  till i couldn t see it     i am highly gratified   said mr  lorry   though  upon my honour  i had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one  dear me  this is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost  dear  dear  dear  to think that there might have been a mrs  lorry  any time these fifty years almost     not at all   from miss pross    you think there never might have been a mrs  lorry   asked the gentleman of that name    pooh   rejoined miss pross   you were a bachelor in your cradle     well   observed mr  lorry  beamingly adjusting his little wig   that seems probable  too     and you were cut out for a bachelor   pursued miss pross   before you were put in your cradle     then  i think   said mr  lorry   that i was very unhandsomely dealt with  and that i ought to have had a voice in the selection of my pattern  enough  now  my dear lucie   drawing his arm soothingly round her waist   i hear them moving in the next room  and miss pross and i  as two formal folks of business  are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear  you leave your good father  my dear  in hands as earnest and as loving as your own  he shall be taken every conceivable care of  during the next fortnight  while you are in warwickshire and thereabouts  even tellson s shall go to the wall  comparatively speaking  before him  and when  at the fortnight s end  he comes to join you and your beloved husband  on your other fortnight s trip in wales  you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame  now  i hear somebody s step coming to the door  let me kiss my dear girl with an old fashioned bachelor blessing  before somebody comes to claim his own    for a moment  he held the fair face from him to look at the well remembered expression on the forehead  and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig  with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which  if such things be old fashioned  were as old as adam   the door of the doctor s room opened  and he came out with charles darnay  he was so deadly pale  which had not been the case when they went in together  that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face  but  in the composure of his manner he was unaltered  except that to the shrewd glance of mr  lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him  like a cold wind   he gave his arm to his daughter  and took her down stairs to the chariot which mr  lorry had hired in honour of the day  the rest followed in another carriage  and soon  in a neighbouring church  where no strange eyes looked on  charles darnay and lucie manette were happily married   besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done  some diamonds  very bright and sparkling  glanced on the bride s hand  which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of mr  lorry s pockets  they returned home to breakfast  and all went well  and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker s white locks in the paris garret  were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight  on the threshold of the door at parting   it was a hard parting  though it was not for long  but her father cheered her  and said at last  gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms   take her  charles  she is yours    and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window  and she was gone   the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious  and the preparations having been very simple and few  the doctor  mr  lorry  and miss pross  were left quite alone  it was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall  that mr  lorry observed a great change to have come over the doctor  as if the golden arm uplifted there  had struck him a poisoned blow   he had naturally repressed much  and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone  but  it was the old scared lost look that troubled mr  lorry  and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up stairs  mr  lorry was reminded of defarge the wine shop keeper  and the starlight ride    i think   he whispered to miss pross  after anxious consideration   i think we had best not speak to him just now  or at all disturb him  i must look in at tellson s  so i will go there at once and come back presently  then  we will take him a ride into the country  and dine there  and all will be well    it was easier for mr  lorry to look in at tellson s  than to look out of tellson s  he was detained two hours  when he came back  he ascended the old staircase alone  having asked no question of the servant  going thus into the doctor s rooms  he was stopped by a low sound of knocking    good god   he said  with a start   what s that    miss pross  with a terrified face  was at his ear   o me  o me  all is lost   cried she  wringing her hands   what is to be told to ladybird  he doesn t know me  and is making shoes    mr  lorry said what he could to calm her  and went himself into the doctor s room  the bench was turned towards the light  as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before  and his head was bent down  and he was very busy    doctor manette  my dear friend  doctor manette    the doctor looked at him for a moment  half inquiringly  half as if he were angry at being spoken to  and bent over his work again   he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat  his shirt was open at the throat  as it used to be when he did that work  and even the old haggard  faded surface of face had come back to him  he worked hard  impatiently  as if in some sense of having been interrupted   mr  lorry glanced at the work in his hand  and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape  he took up another that was lying by him  and asked what it was    a young lady s walking shoe   he muttered  without looking up   it ought to have been finished long ago  let it be     but  doctor manette  look at me    he obeyed  in the old mechanically submissive manner  without pausing in his work    you know me  my dear friend  think again  this is not your proper occupation  think  dear friend    nothing would induce him to speak more  he looked up  for an instant at a time  when he was requested to do so  but  no persuasion would extract a word from him  he worked  and worked  and worked  in silence  and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall  or on the air  the only ray of hope that mr  lorry could discover  was  that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked  in that  there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity  as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind   two things at once impressed themselves on mr  lorry  as important above all others  the first  that this must be kept secret from lucie  the second  that it must be kept secret from all who knew him  in conjunction with miss pross  he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution  by giving out that the doctor was not well  and required a few days of complete rest  in aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter  miss pross was to write  describing his having been called away professionally  and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand  represented to have been addressed to her by the same post   these measures  advisable to be taken in any case  mr  lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself  if that should happen soon  he kept another course in reserve  which was  to have a certain opinion that he thought the best  on the doctor s case   in the hope of his recovery  and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable  mr  lorry resolved to watch him attentively  with as little appearance as possible of doing so  he therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellson s for the first time in his life  and took his post by the window in the same room   he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him  since  on being pressed  he became worried  he abandoned that attempt on the first day  and resolved merely to keep himself always before him  as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen  or was falling  he remained  therefore  in his seat near the window  reading and writing  and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of  that it was a free place   doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink  and worked on  that first day  until it was too dark to see  worked on  half an hour after mr  lorry could not have seen  for his life  to read or write  when he put his tools aside as useless  until morning  mr  lorry rose and said to him    will you go out    he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner  looked up in the old manner  and repeated in the old low voice    out     yes  for a walk with me  why not    he made no effort to say why not  and said not a word more  but  mr  lorry thought he saw  as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk  with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands  that he was in some misty way asking himself   why not   the sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here  and determined to hold it   miss pross and he divided the night into two watches  and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room  he paced up and down for a long time before he lay down  but  when he did finally lay himself down  he fell asleep  in the morning  he was up betimes  and went straight to his bench and to work   on this second day  mr  lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name  and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them  he returned no reply  but it was evident that he heard what was said  and that he thought about it  however confusedly  this encouraged mr  lorry to have miss pross in with her work  several times during the day  at those times  they quietly spoke of lucie  and of her father then present  precisely in the usual manner  and as if there were nothing amiss  this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment  not long enough  or often enough to harass him  and it lightened mr  lorry s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener  and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him   when it fell dark again  mr  lorry asked him as before    dear doctor  will you go out    as before  he repeated   out     yes  for a walk with me  why not    this time  mr  lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him  and  after remaining absent for an hour  returned  in the meanwhile  the doctor had removed to the seat in the window  and had sat there looking down at the plane tree  but  on mr  lorry s return  he slipped away to his bench   the time went very slowly on  and mr  lorry s hope darkened  and his heart grew heavier again  and grew yet heavier and heavier every day  the third day came and went  the fourth  the fifth  five days  six days  seven days  eight days  nine days   with a hope ever darkening  and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier  mr  lorry passed through this anxious time  the secret was well kept  and lucie was unconscious and happy  but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker  whose hand had been a little out at first  was growing dreadfully skilful  and that he had never been so intent on his work  and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert  as in the dusk of the ninth evening      xix  an opinion   worn out by anxious watching  mr  lorry fell asleep at his post  on the tenth morning of his suspense  he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night   he rubbed his eyes and roused himself  but he doubted  when he had done so  whether he was not still asleep  for  going to the door of the doctor s room and looking in  he perceived that the shoemaker s bench and tools were put aside again  and that the doctor himself sat reading at the window  he was in his usual morning dress  and his face  which mr  lorry could distinctly see   though still very pale  was calmly studious and attentive   even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake  mr  lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own  for  did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect  and employed as usual  and was there any sign within their range  that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened   it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment  the answer being obvious  if the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause  how came he  jarvis lorry  there  how came he to have fallen asleep  in his clothes  on the sofa in doctor manette s consulting room  and to be debating these points outside the doctor s bedroom door in the early morning   within a few minutes  miss pross stood whispering at his side  if he had had any particle of doubt left  her talk would of necessity have resolved it  but he was by that time clear headed  and had none  he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast hour  and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred  if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind  mr  lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been  in his anxiety  so anxious to obtain   miss pross  submitting herself to his judgment  the scheme was worked out with care  having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette  mr  lorry presented himself at the breakfast hour in his usual white linen  and with his usual neat leg  the doctor was summoned in the usual way  and came to breakfast   so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which mr  lorry felt to be the only safe advance  he at first supposed that his daughter s marriage had taken place yesterday  an incidental allusion  purposely thrown out  to the day of the week  and the day of the month  set him thinking and counting  and evidently made him uneasy  in all other respects  however  he was so composedly himself  that mr  lorry determined to have the aid he sought  and that aid was his own   therefore  when the breakfast was done and cleared away  and he and the doctor were left together  mr  lorry said  feelingly    my dear manette  i am anxious to have your opinion  in confidence  on a very curious case in which i am deeply interested  that is to say  it is very curious to me  perhaps  to your better information it may be less so    glancing at his hands  which were discoloured by his late work  the doctor looked troubled  and listened attentively  he had already glanced at his hands more than once    doctor manette   said mr  lorry  touching him affectionately on the arm   the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine  pray give your mind to it  and advise me well for his sake  and above all  for his daughter s  his daughter s  my dear manette     if i understand   said the doctor  in a subdued tone   some mental shock       yes     be explicit   said the doctor   spare no detail    mr  lorry saw that they understood one another  and proceeded    my dear manette  it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock  of great acuteness and severity to the affections  the feelings  the  the  as you express it  the mind  the mind  it is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down  one cannot say for how long  because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself  and there are no other means of getting at it  it is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered  by a process that he cannot trace himself  as i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner  it is the case of a shock from which he has recovered  so completely  as to be a highly intelligent man  capable of close application of mind  and great exertion of body  and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge  which was already very large  but  unfortunately  there has been   he paused and took a deep breath   a slight relapse    the doctor  in a low voice  asked   of how long duration     nine days and nights     how did it show itself  i infer   glancing at his hands again   in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock     that is the fact     now  did you ever see him   asked the doctor  distinctly and collectedly  though in the same low voice   engaged in that pursuit originally     once     and when the relapse fell on him  was he in most respects  or in all respects  as he was then     i think in all respects     you spoke of his daughter  does his daughter know of the relapse     no  it has been kept from her  and i hope will always be kept from her  it is known only to myself  and to one other who may be trusted    the doctor grasped his hand  and murmured   that was very kind  that was very thoughtful   mr  lorry grasped his hand in return  and neither of the two spoke for a little while    now  my dear manette   said mr  lorry  at length  in his most considerate and most affectionate way   i am a mere man of business  and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters  i do not possess the kind of information necessary  i do not possess the kind of intelligence  i want guiding  there is no man in this world on whom i could so rely for right guidance  as on you  tell me  how does this relapse come about  is there danger of another  could a repetition of it be prevented  how should a repetition of it be treated  how does it come about at all  what can i do for my friend  no man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend  than i am to serve mine  if i knew how    but i don t know how to originate  in such a case  if your sagacity  knowledge  and experience  could put me on the right track  i might be able to do so much  unenlightened and undirected  i can do so little  pray discuss it with me  pray enable me to see it a little more clearly  and teach me how to be a little more useful    doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken  and mr  lorry did not press him    i think it probable   said the doctor  breaking silence with an effort   that the relapse you have described  my dear friend  was not quite unforeseen by its subject     was it dreaded by him   mr  lorry ventured to ask    very much   he said it with an involuntary shudder    you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer s mind  and how difficult  how almost impossible  it is  for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him     would he   asked mr  lorry   be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one  when it is on him     i think so  but it is  as i have told you  next to impossible  i even believe it  in some cases  to be quite impossible     now   said mr  lorry  gently laying his hand on the doctor s arm again  after a short silence on both sides   to what would you refer this attack     i believe   returned doctor manette   that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady  some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled  i think  it is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind  that those associations would be recalled  say  under certain circumstances  say  on a particular occasion  he tried to prepare himself in vain  perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it     would he remember what took place in the relapse   asked mr  lorry  with natural hesitation   the doctor looked desolately round the room  shook his head  and answered  in a low voice   not at all     now  as to the future   hinted mr  lorry    as to the future   said the doctor  recovering firmness   i should have great hope  as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon  i should have great hope  he  yielding under the pressure of a complicated something  long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against  and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed  i should hope that the worst was over     well  well  that s good comfort  i am thankful   said mr  lorry    i am thankful   repeated the doctor  bending his head with reverence    there are two other points   said mr  lorry   on which i am anxious to be instructed  i may go on     you cannot do your friend a better service   the doctor gave him his hand    to the first  then  he is of a studious habit  and unusually energetic  he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge  to the conducting of experiments  to many things  now  does he do too much     i think not  it may be the character of his mind  to be always in singular need of occupation  that may be  in part  natural to it  in part  the result of affliction  the less it was occupied with healthy things  the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction  he may have observed himself  and made the discovery     you are sure that he is not under too great a strain     i think i am quite sure of it     my dear manette  if he were overworked now      my dear lorry  i doubt if that could easily be  there has been a violent stress in one direction  and it needs a counterweight     excuse me  as a persistent man of business  assuming for a moment  that he was overworked  it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder     i do not think so  i do not think   said doctor manette with the firmness of self conviction   that anything but the one train of association would renew it  i think that  henceforth  nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it  after what has happened  and after his recovery  i find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again  i trust  and i almost believe  that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted    he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind  and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress  it was not for his friend to abate that confidence  he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was  and approached his second and last point  he felt it to be the most difficult of all  but  remembering his old sunday morning conversation with miss pross  and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days  he knew that he must face it    the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from   said mr  lorry  clearing his throat   we will call  blacksmith s work  blacksmith s work  we will say  to put a case and for the sake of illustration  that he had been used  in his bad time  to work at a little forge  we will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again  is it not a pity that he should keep it by him    the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand  and beat his foot nervously on the ground    he has always kept it by him   said mr  lorry  with an anxious look at his friend   now  would it not be better that he should let it go    still  the doctor  with shaded forehead  beat his foot nervously on the ground    you do not find it easy to advise me   said mr  lorry   i quite understand it to be a nice question  and yet i think    and there he shook his head  and stopped    you see   said doctor manette  turning to him after an uneasy pause   it is very hard to explain  consistently  the innermost workings of this poor man s mind  he once yearned so frightfully for that occupation  and it was so welcome when it came  no doubt it relieved his pain so much  by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain  and by substituting  as he became more practised  the ingenuity of the hands  for the ingenuity of the mental torture  that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach  even now  when i believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been  and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence  the idea that he might need that old employment  and not find it  gives him a sudden sense of terror  like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child    he looked like his illustration  as he raised his eyes to mr  lorry s face    but may not  mind  i ask for information  as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas  shillings  and bank notes  may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea  if the thing were gone  my dear manette  might not the fear go with it  in short  is it not a concession to the misgiving  to keep the forge    there was another silence    you see  too   said the doctor  tremulously   it is such an old companion     i would not keep it   said mr  lorry  shaking his head  for he gained in firmness as he saw the doctor disquieted   i would recommend him to sacrifice it  i only want your authority  i am sure it does no good  come  give me your authority  like a dear good man  for his daughter s sake  my dear manette    very strange to see what a struggle there was within him    in her name  then  let it be done  i sanction it  but  i would not take it away while he was present  let it be removed when he is not there  let him miss his old companion after an absence    mr  lorry readily engaged for that  and the conference was ended  they passed the day in the country  and the doctor was quite restored  on the three following days he remained perfectly well  and on the fourteenth day he went away to join lucie and her husband  the precaution that had been taken to account for his silence  mr  lorry had previously explained to him  and he had written to lucie in accordance with it  and she had no suspicions   on the night of the day on which he left the house  mr  lorry went into his room with a chopper  saw  chisel  and hammer  attended by miss pross carrying a light  there  with closed doors  and in a mysterious and guilty manner  mr  lorry hacked the shoemaker s bench to pieces  while miss pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder  for which  indeed  in her grimness  she was no unsuitable figure  the burning of the body  previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose  was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire  and the tools  shoes  and leather  were buried in the garden  so wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds  that mr  lorry and miss pross  while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces  almost felt  and almost looked  like accomplices in a horrible crime      xx  a plea   when the newly married pair came home  the first person who appeared  to offer his congratulations  was sydney carton  they had not been at home many hours  when he presented himself  he was not improved in habits  or in looks  or in manner  but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him  which was new to the observation of charles darnay   he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window  and of speaking to him when no one overheard    mr  darnay   said carton   i wish we might be friends     we are already friends  i hope     you are good enough to say so  as a fashion of speech  but  i don t mean any fashion of speech  indeed  when i say i wish we might be friends  i scarcely mean quite that  either    charles darnay  as was natural  asked him  in all good humour and good fellowship  what he did mean    upon my life   said carton  smiling   i find that easier to comprehend in my own mind  than to convey to yours  however  let me try  you remember a certain famous occasion when i was more drunk than  than usual     i remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking     i remember it too  the curse of those occasions is heavy upon me  for i always remember them  i hope it may be taken into account one day  when all days are at an end for me  don t be alarmed  i am not going to preach     i am not at all alarmed  earnestness in you  is anything but alarming to me     ah   said carton  with a careless wave of his hand  as if he waved that away   on the drunken occasion in question  one of a large number  as you know   i was insufferable about liking you  and not liking you  i wish you would forget it     i forgot it long ago     fashion of speech again  but  mr  darnay  oblivion is not so easy to me  as you represent it to be to you  i have by no means forgotten it  and a light answer does not help me to forget it     if it was a light answer   returned darnay   i beg your forgiveness for it  i had no other object than to turn a slight thing  which  to my surprise  seems to trouble you too much  aside  i declare to you  on the faith of a gentleman  that i have long dismissed it from my mind  good heaven  what was there to dismiss  have i had nothing more important to remember  in the great service you rendered me that day     as to the great service   said carton   i am bound to avow to you  when you speak of it in that way  that it was mere professional claptrap  i don t know that i cared what became of you  when i rendered it   mind  i say when i rendered it  i am speaking of the past     you make light of the obligation   returned darnay   but i will not quarrel with your light answer     genuine truth  mr  darnay  trust me  i have gone aside from my purpose  i was speaking about our being friends  now  you know me  you know i am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men  if you doubt it  ask stryver  and he ll tell you so     i prefer to form my own opinion  without the aid of his     well  at any rate you know me as a dissolute dog  who has never done any good  and never will     i don t know that you  never will      but i do  and you must take my word for it  well  if you could endure to have such a worthless fellow  and a fellow of such indifferent reputation  coming and going at odd times  i should ask that i might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here  that i might be regarded as an useless  and i would add  if it were not for the resemblance i detected between you and me  an unornamental  piece of furniture  tolerated for its old service  and taken no notice of  i doubt if i should abuse the permission  it is a hundred to one if i should avail myself of it four times in a year  it would satisfy me  i dare say  to know that i had it     will you try     that is another way of saying that i am placed on the footing i have indicated  i thank you  darnay  i may use that freedom with your name     i think so  carton  by this time    they shook hands upon it  and sydney turned away  within a minute afterwards  he was  to all outward appearance  as unsubstantial as ever   when he was gone  and in the course of an evening passed with miss pross  the doctor  and mr  lorry  charles darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms  and spoke of sydney carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness  he spoke of him  in short  not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him  but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself   he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife  but  when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms  he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked    we are thoughtful to night   said darnay  drawing his arm about her    yes  dearest charles   with her hands on his breast  and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him   we are rather thoughtful to night  for we have something on our mind to night     what is it  my lucie     will you promise not to press one question on me  if i beg you not to ask it     will i promise  what will i not promise to my love    what  indeed  with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek  and his other hand against the heart that beat for him    i think  charles  poor mr  carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to night     indeed  my own  why so     that is what you are not to ask me  but i think  i know  he does     if you know it  it is enough  what would you have me do  my life     i would ask you  dearest  to be very generous with him always  and very lenient on his faults when he is not by  i would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very  very seldom reveals  and that there are deep wounds in it  my dear  i have seen it bleeding     it is a painful reflection to me   said charles darnay  quite astounded   that i should have done him any wrong  i never thought this of him     my husband  it is so  i fear he is not to be reclaimed  there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now  but  i am sure that he is capable of good things  gentle things  even magnanimous things    she looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man  that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours    and  o my dearest love   she urged  clinging nearer to him  laying her head upon his breast  and raising her eyes to his   remember how strong we are in our happiness  and how weak he is in his misery    the supplication touched him home   i will always remember it  dear heart  i will remember it as long as i live    he bent over the golden head  and put the rosy lips to his  and folded her in his arms  if one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets  could have heard her innocent disclosure  and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband  he might have cried to the night  and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time     god bless her for her sweet compassion       xxi  echoing footsteps   a wonderful corner for echoes  it has been remarked  that corner where the doctor lived  ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband  and her father  and herself  and her old directress and companion  in a life of quiet bliss  lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner  listening to the echoing footsteps of years   at first  there were times  though she was a perfectly happy young wife  when her work would slowly fall from her hands  and her eyes would be dimmed  for  there was something coming in the echoes  something light  afar off  and scarcely audible yet  that stirred her heart too much  fluttering hopes and doubts  hopes  of a love as yet unknown to her  doubts  of her remaining upon earth  to enjoy that new delight  divided her breast  among the echoes then  there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave  and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate  and who would mourn for her so much  swelled to her eyes  and broke like waves   that time passed  and her little lucie lay on her bosom  then  among the advancing echoes  there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words  let greater echoes resound as they would  the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming  they came  and the shady house was sunny with a child s laugh  and the divine friend of children  to whom in her trouble she had confided hers  seemed to take her child in his arms  as he took the child of old  and made it a sacred joy to her   ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together  weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives  and making it predominate nowhere  lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds  her husband s step was strong and prosperous among them  her father s firm and equal  lo  miss pross  in harness of string  awakening the echoes  as an unruly charger  whip corrected  snorting and pawing the earth under the plane tree in the garden   even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest  they were not harsh nor cruel  even when golden hair  like her own  lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy  and he said  with a radiant smile   dear papa and mamma  i am very sorry to leave you both  and to leave my pretty sister  but i am called  and i must go   those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother s cheek  as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it  suffer them and forbid them not  they see my father s face  o father  blessed words   thus  the rustling of an angel s wings got blended with the other echoes  and they were not wholly of earth  but had in them that breath of heaven  sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden tomb were mingled with them also  and both were audible to lucie  in a hushed murmur  like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore  as the little lucie  comically studious at the task of the morning  or dressing a doll at her mother s footstool  chattered in the tongues of the two cities that were blended in her life   the echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of sydney carton  some half dozen times a year  at most  he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited  and would sit among them through the evening  as he had once done often  he never came there heated with wine  and one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes  which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages   no man ever really loved a woman  lost her  and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind  when she was a wife and a mother  but her children had a strange sympathy with him  an instinctive delicacy of pity for him  what fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case  no echoes tell  but it is so  and it was so here  carton was the first stranger to whom little lucie held out her chubby arms  and he kept his place with her as she grew  the little boy had spoken of him  almost at the last   poor carton  kiss him for me    mr  stryver shouldered his way through the law  like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water  and dragged his useful friend in his wake  like a boat towed astern  as the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight  and mostly under water  so  sydney had a swamped life of it  but  easy and strong custom  unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace  made it the life he was to lead  and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lion s jackal  than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion  stryver was rich  had married a florid widow with property and three boys  who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads   these three young gentlemen  mr  stryver  exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore  had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in soho  and had offered as pupils to lucie s husband  delicately saying  halloa  here are three lumps of bread and cheese towards your matrimonial picnic  darnay   the polite rejection of the three lumps of bread and cheese had quite bloated mr  stryver with indignation  which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen  by directing them to beware of the pride of beggars  like that tutor fellow  he was also in the habit of declaiming to mrs  stryver  over his full bodied wine  on the arts mrs  darnay had once put in practice to  catch  him  and on the diamond cut diamond arts in himself  madam  which had rendered him  not to be caught   some of his king s bench familiars  who were occasionally parties to the full bodied wine and the lie  excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often  that he believed it himself  which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence  as to justify any such offender s being carried off to some suitably retired spot  and there hanged out of the way   these were among the echoes to which lucie  sometimes pensive  sometimes amused and laughing  listened in the echoing corner  until her little daughter was six years old  how near to her heart the echoes of her child s tread came  and those of her own dear father s  always active and self possessed  and those of her dear husband s  need not be told  nor  how the lightest echo of their united home  directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste  was music to her  nor  how there were echoes all about her  sweet in her ears  of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married  if that could be  than single  and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him  and asked her  what is the magic secret  my darling  of your being everything to all of us  as if there were only one of us  yet never seeming to be hurried  or to have too much to do    but  there were other echoes  from a distance  that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time  and it was now  about little lucie s sixth birthday  that they began to have an awful sound  as of a great storm in france with a dreadful sea rising   on a night in mid july  one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine  mr  lorry came in late  from tellson s  and sat himself down by lucie and her husband in the dark window  it was a hot  wild night  and they were all three reminded of the old sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place    i began to think   said mr  lorry  pushing his brown wig back   that i should have to pass the night at tellson s  we have been so full of business all day  that we have not known what to do first  or which way to turn  there is such an uneasiness in paris  that we have actually a run of confidence upon us  our customers over there  seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough  there is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to england     that has a bad look   said darnay     a bad look  you say  my dear darnay  yes  but we don t know what reason there is in it  people are so unreasonable  some of us at tellson s are getting old  and we really can t be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion     still   said darnay   you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is     i know that  to be sure   assented mr  lorry  trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured  and that he grumbled   but i am determined to be peevish after my long day s botheration  where is manette     here he is   said the doctor  entering the dark room at the moment    i am quite glad you are at home  for these hurries and forebodings by which i have been surrounded all day long  have made me nervous without reason  you are not going out  i hope     no  i am going to play backgammon with you  if you like   said the doctor    i don t think i do like  if i may speak my mind  i am not fit to be pitted against you to night  is the teaboard still there  lucie  i can t see     of course  it has been kept for you     thank ye  my dear  the precious child is safe in bed     and sleeping soundly     that s right  all safe and well  i don t know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here  thank god  but i have been so put out all day  and i am not as young as i was  my tea  my dear  thank ye  now  come and take your place in the circle  and let us sit quiet  and hear the echoes about which you have your theory     not a theory  it was a fancy     a fancy  then  my wise pet   said mr  lorry  patting her hand   they are very numerous and very loud  though  are they not  only hear them    headlong  mad  and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody s life  footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red  the footsteps raging in saint antoine afar off  as the little circle sat in the dark london window   saint antoine had been  that morning  a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro  with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads  where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun  a tremendous roar arose from the throat of saint antoine  and a forest of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind  all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below  no matter how far off   who gave them out  whence they last came  where they began  through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked  scores at a time  over the heads of the crowd  like a kind of lightning  no eye in the throng could have told  but  muskets were being distributed  so were cartridges  powder  and ball  bars of iron and wood  knives  axes  pikes  every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise  people who could lay hold of nothing else  set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls  every pulse and heart in saint antoine was on high fever strain and at high fever heat  every living creature there held life as of no account  and was demented with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it   as a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point  so  all this raging circled round defarge s wine shop  and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where defarge himself  already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat  issued orders  issued arms  thrust this man back  dragged this man forward  disarmed one to arm another  laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar    keep near to me  jacques three   cried defarge   and do you  jacques one and two  separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can  where is my wife     eh  well  here you see me   said madame  composed as ever  but not knitting to day  madame s resolute right hand was occupied with an axe  in place of the usual softer implements  and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife    where do you go  my wife     i go   said madame   with you at present  you shall see me at the head of women  by and bye     come  then   cried defarge  in a resounding voice   patriots and friends  we are ready  the bastille    with a roar that sounded as if all the breath in france had been shaped into the detested word  the living sea rose  wave on wave  depth on depth  and overflowed the city to that point  alarm bells ringing  drums beating  the sea raging and thundering on its new beach  the attack began   deep ditches  double drawbridge  massive stone walls  eight great towers  cannon  muskets  fire and smoke  through the fire and through the smoke  in the fire and in the smoke  for the sea cast him up against a cannon  and on the instant he became a cannonier  defarge of the wine shop worked like a manful soldier  two fierce hours   deep ditch  single drawbridge  massive stone walls  eight great towers  cannon  muskets  fire and smoke  one drawbridge down   work  comrades all  work  work  jacques one  jacques two  jacques one thousand  jacques two thousand  jacques five and twenty thousand  in the name of all the angels or the devils  which you prefer  work   thus defarge of the wine shop  still at his gun  which had long grown hot    to me  women   cried madame his wife   what  we can kill as well as the men when the place is taken   and to her  with a shrill thirsty cry  trooping women variously armed  but all armed alike in hunger and revenge   cannon  muskets  fire and smoke  but  still the deep ditch  the single drawbridge  the massive stone walls  and the eight great towers  slight displacements of the raging sea  made by the falling wounded  flashing weapons  blazing torches  smoking waggonloads of wet straw  hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions  shrieks  volleys  execrations  bravery without stint  boom smash and rattle  and the furious sounding of the living sea  but  still the deep ditch  and the single drawbridge  and the massive stone walls  and the eight great towers  and still defarge of the wine shop at his gun  grown doubly hot by the service of four fierce hours   a white flag from within the fortress  and a parley  this dimly perceptible through the raging storm  nothing audible in it  suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher  and swept defarge of the wine shop over the lowered drawbridge  past the massive stone outer walls  in among the eight great towers surrendered   so resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on  that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the south sea  until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the bastille  there  against an angle of a wall  he made a struggle to look about him  jacques three was nearly at his side  madame defarge  still heading some of her women  was visible in the inner distance  and her knife was in her hand  everywhere was tumult  exultation  deafening and maniacal bewilderment  astounding noise  yet furious dumb show    the prisoners     the records     the secret cells     the instruments of torture     the prisoners    of all these cries  and ten thousand incoherences   the prisoners   was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in  as if there were an eternity of people  as well as of time and space  when the foremost billows rolled past  bearing the prison officers with them  and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed  defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men  a man with a grey head  who had a lighted torch in his hand  separated him from the rest  and got him between himself and the wall    show me the north tower   said defarge   quick     i will faithfully   replied the man   if you will come with me  but there is no one there     what is the meaning of one hundred and five  north tower   asked defarge   quick     the meaning  monsieur     does it mean a captive  or a place of captivity  or do you mean that i shall strike you dead     kill him   croaked jacques three  who had come close up    monsieur  it is a cell     show it me     pass this way  then    jacques three  with his usual craving on him  and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed  held by defarge s arm as he held by the turnkey s  their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse  and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another  even then  so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean  in its irruption into the fortress  and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases  all around outside  too  it beat the walls with a deep  hoarse roar  from which  occasionally  some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray   through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone  past hideous doors of dark dens and cages  down cavernous flights of steps  and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick  more like dry waterfalls than staircases  defarge  the turnkey  and jacques three  linked hand and arm  went with all the speed they could make  here and there  especially at first  the inundation started on them and swept by  but when they had done descending  and were winding and climbing up a tower  they were alone  hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches  the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull  subdued way  as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing   the turnkey stopped at a low door  put a key in a clashing lock  swung the door slowly open  and said  as they all bent their heads and passed in    one hundred and five  north tower    there was a small  heavily grated  unglazed window high in the wall  with a stone screen before it  so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up  there was a small chimney  heavily barred across  a few feet within  there was a heap of old feathery wood ashes on the hearth  there was a stool  and table  and a straw bed  there were the four blackened walls  and a rusted iron ring in one of them    pass that torch slowly along these walls  that i may see them   said defarge to the turnkey   the man obeyed  and defarge followed the light closely with his eyes    stop   look here  jacques     a  m    croaked jacques three  as he read greedily    alexandre manette   said defarge in his ear  following the letters with his swart forefinger  deeply engrained with gunpowder   and here he wrote  a poor physician   and it was he  without doubt  who scratched a calendar on this stone  what is that in your hand  a crowbar  give it me    he had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand  he made a sudden exchange of the two instruments  and turning on the worm eaten stool and table  beat them to pieces in a few blows    hold the light higher   he said  wrathfully  to the turnkey   look among those fragments with care  jacques  and see  here is my knife    throwing it to him   rip open that bed  and search the straw  hold the light higher  you    with a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth  and  peering up the chimney  struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar  and worked at the iron grating across it  in a few minutes  some mortar and dust came dropping down  which he averted his face to avoid  and in it  and in the old wood ashes  and in a crevice in the chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself  he groped with a cautious touch    nothing in the wood  and nothing in the straw  jacques     nothing     let us collect them together  in the middle of the cell  so  light them  you    the turnkey fired the little pile  which blazed high and hot  stooping again to come out at the low arched door  they left it burning  and retraced their way to the courtyard  seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down  until they were in the raging flood once more   they found it surging and tossing  in quest of defarge himself  saint antoine was clamorous to have its wine shop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the bastille and shot the people  otherwise  the governor would not be marched to the hotel de ville for judgment  otherwise  the governor would escape  and the people s blood  suddenly of some value  after many years of worthlessness  be unavenged   in the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration  there was but one quite steady figure  and that was a woman s   see  there is my husband   she cried  pointing him out   see defarge   she stood immovable close to the grim old officer  and remained immovable close to him  remained immovable close to him through the streets  as defarge and the rest bore him along  remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination  and began to be struck at from behind  remained immovable close to him when the long gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy  was so close to him when he dropped dead under it  that  suddenly animated  she put her foot upon his neck  and with her cruel knife  long ready  hewed off his head   the hour was come  when saint antoine was to execute his horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do  saint antoine s blood was up  and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down  down on the steps of the hotel de ville where the governor s body lay  down on the sole of the shoe of madame defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation   lower the lamp yonder   cried saint antoine  after glaring round for a new means of death   here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard   the swinging sentinel was posted  and the sea rushed on   the sea of black and threatening waters  and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave  whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown  the remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes  voices of vengeance  and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them   but  in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life  there were two groups of faces  each seven in number  so fixedly contrasting with the rest  that never did sea roll which bore more memorable wrecks with it  seven faces of prisoners  suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb  were carried high overhead  all scared  all lost  all wondering and amazed  as if the last day were come  and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits  other seven faces there were  carried higher  seven dead faces  whose drooping eyelids and half seen eyes awaited the last day  impassive faces  yet with a suspended  not an abolished  expression on them  faces  rather  in a fearful pause  as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes  and bear witness with the bloodless lips   thou didst it    seven prisoners released  seven gory heads on pikes  the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers  some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time  long dead of broken hearts   such  and such  like  the loudly echoing footsteps of saint antoine escort through the paris streets in mid july  one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine  now  heaven defeat the fancy of lucie darnay  and keep these feet far out of her life  for  they are headlong  mad  and dangerous  and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at defarge s wine shop door  they are not easily purified when once stained red      xxii  the sea still rises   haggard saint antoine had had only one exultant week  in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could  with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations  when madame defarge sat at her counter  as usual  presiding over the customers  madame defarge wore no rose in her head  for the great brotherhood of spies had become  even in one short week  extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint s mercies  the lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them   madame defarge  with her arms folded  sat in the morning light and heat  contemplating the wine shop and the street  in both  there were several knots of loungers  squalid and miserable  but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress  the raggedest nightcap  awry on the wretchedest head  had this crooked significance in it   i know how hard it has grown for me  the wearer of this  to support life in myself  but do you know how easy it has grown for me  the wearer of this  to destroy life in you   every lean bare arm  that had been without work before  had this work always ready for it now  that it could strike  the fingers of the knitting women were vicious  with the experience that they could tear  there was a change in the appearance of saint antoine  the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years  and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression   madame defarge sat observing it  with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the saint antoine women  one of her sisterhood knitted beside her  the short  rather plump wife of a starved grocer  and the mother of two children withal  this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of the vengeance    hark   said the vengeance   listen  then  who comes    as if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of saint antoine quarter to the wine shop door  had been suddenly fired  a fast spreading murmur came rushing along    it is defarge   said madame   silence  patriots    defarge came in breathless  pulled off a red cap he wore  and looked around him   listen  everywhere   said madame again   listen to him    defarge stood  panting  against a background of eager eyes and open mouths  formed outside the door  all those within the wine shop had sprung to their feet    say then  my husband  what is it     news from the other world     how  then   cried madame  contemptuously   the other world     does everybody here recall old foulon  who told the famished people that they might eat grass  and who died  and went to hell     everybody   from all throats    the news is of him  he is among us     among us   from the universal throat again   and dead     not dead  he feared us so much  and with reason  that he caused himself to be represented as dead  and had a grand mock funeral  but they have found him alive  hiding in the country  and have brought him in  i have seen him but now  on his way to the hotel de ville  a prisoner  i have said that he had reason to fear us  say all  had he reason    wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten  if he had never known it yet  he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry   a moment of profound silence followed  defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another  the vengeance stooped  and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter    patriots   said defarge  in a determined voice   are we ready    instantly madame defarge s knife was in her girdle  the drum was beating in the streets  as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic  and the vengeance  uttering terrific shrieks  and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty furies at once  was tearing from house to house  rousing the women   the men were terrible  in the bloody minded anger with which they looked from windows  caught up what arms they had  and came pouring down into the streets  but  the women were a sight to chill the boldest  from such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded  from their children  from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked  they ran out with streaming hair  urging one another  and themselves  to madness with the wildest cries and actions  villain foulon taken  my sister  old foulon taken  my mother  miscreant foulon taken  my daughter  then  a score of others ran into the midst of these  beating their breasts  tearing their hair  and screaming  foulon alive  foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass  foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass  when i had no bread to give him  foulon who told my baby it might suck grass  when these breasts were dry with want  o mother of god  this foulon  o heaven our suffering  hear me  my dead baby and my withered father  i swear on my knees  on these stones  to avenge you on foulon  husbands  and brothers  and young men  give us the blood of foulon  give us the head of foulon  give us the heart of foulon  give us the body and soul of foulon  rend foulon to pieces  and dig him into the ground  that grass may grow from him  with these cries  numbers of the women  lashed into blind frenzy  whirled about  striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon  and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot   nevertheless  not a moment was lost  not a moment  this foulon was at the hotel de ville  and might be loosed  never  if saint antoine knew his own sufferings  insults  and wrongs  armed men and women flocked out of the quarter so fast  and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction  that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in saint antoine s bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children   no  they were all by that time choking the hall of examination where this old man  ugly and wicked  was  and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets  the defarges  husband and wife  the vengeance  and jacques three  were in the first press  and at no great distance from him in the hall    see   cried madame  pointing with her knife   see the old villain bound with ropes  that was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back  ha  ha  that was well done  let him eat it now   madame put her knife under her arm  and clapped her hands as at a play   the people immediately behind madame defarge  explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them  and those again explaining to others  and those to others  the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands  similarly  during two or three hours of drawl  and the winnowing of many bushels of words  madame defarge s frequent expressions of impatience were taken up  with marvellous quickness  at a distance  the more readily  because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows  knew madame defarge well  and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building   at length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or protection  directly down upon the old prisoner s head  the favour was too much to bear  in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long  went to the winds  and saint antoine had got him   it was known directly  to the furthest confines of the crowd  defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table  and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace  madame defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied  the vengeance and jacques three were not yet up with them  and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the hall  like birds of prey from their high perches  when the cry seemed to go up  all over the city   bring him out  bring him to the lamp    down  and up  and head foremost on the steps of the building  now  on his knees  now  on his feet  now  on his back  dragged  and struck at  and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands  torn  bruised  panting  bleeding  yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy  now full of vehement agony of action  with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see  now  a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs  he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung  and there madame defarge let him go  as a cat might have done to a mouse  and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready  and while he besought her  the women passionately screeching at him all the time  and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth  once  he went aloft  and the rope broke  and they caught him shrieking  twice  he went aloft  and the rope broke  and they caught him shrieking  then  the rope was merciful  and held him  and his head was soon upon a pike  with grass enough in the mouth for all saint antoine to dance at the sight of   nor was this the end of the day s bad work  for saint antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up  that it boiled again  on hearing when the day closed in that the son in law of the despatched  another of the people s enemies and insulters  was coming into paris under a guard five hundred strong  in cavalry alone  saint antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper  seized him  would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear foulon company  set his head and heart on pikes  and carried the three spoils of the day  in wolf procession through the streets   not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children  wailing and breadless  then  the miserable bakers  shops were beset by long files of them  patiently waiting to buy bad bread  and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty  they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day  and achieving them again in gossip  gradually  these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away  and then poor lights began to shine in high windows  and slender fires were made in the streets  at which neighbours cooked in common  afterwards supping at their doors   scanty and insufficient suppers those  and innocent of meat  as of most other sauce to wretched bread  yet  human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands  and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them  fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day  played gently with their meagre children  and lovers  with such a world around them and before them  loved and hoped   it was almost morning  when defarge s wine shop parted with its last knot of customers  and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife  in husky tones  while fastening the door    at last it is come  my dear     eh well   returned madame   almost    saint antoine slept  the defarges slept  even the vengeance slept with her starved grocer  and the drum was at rest  the drum s was the only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed  the vengeance  as custodian of the drum  could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the bastille fell  or old foulon was seized  not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in saint antoine s bosom      xxiii  fire rises   there was a change on the village where the fountain fell  and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together  the prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore  there were soldiers to guard it  but not many  there were officers to guard the soldiers  but not one of them knew what his men would do  beyond this  that it would probably not be what he was ordered   far and wide lay a ruined country  yielding nothing but desolation  every green leaf  every blade of grass and blade of grain  was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people  everything was bowed down  dejected  oppressed  and broken  habitations  fences  domesticated animals  men  women  children  and the soil that bore them  all worn out   monseigneur  often a most worthy individual gentleman  was a national blessing  gave a chivalrous tone to things  was a polite example of luxurious and shining life  and a great deal more to equal purpose  nevertheless  monseigneur as a class had  somehow or other  brought things to this  strange that creation  designed expressly for monseigneur  should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out  there must be something short sighted in the eternal arrangements  surely  thus it was  however  and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints  and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled  and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite  monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable   but  this was not the change on the village  and on many a village like it  for scores of years gone by  monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it  and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase  now  found in hunting the people  now  found in hunting the beasts  for whose preservation monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness  no  the change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste  rather than in the disappearance of the high caste  chiselled  and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of monseigneur   for  in these times  as the mender of roads worked  solitary  in the dust  not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return  being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it  in these times  as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour  and viewed the prospect  he would see some rough figure approaching on foot  the like of which was once a rarity in those parts  but was now a frequent presence  as it advanced  the mender of roads would discern without surprise  that it was a shaggy haired man  of almost barbarian aspect  tall  in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads  grim  rough  swart  steeped in the mud and dust of many highways  dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds  sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods   such a man came upon him  like a ghost  at noon in the july weather  as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank  taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail   the man looked at him  looked at the village in the hollow  at the mill  and at the prison on the crag  when he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had  he said  in a dialect that was just intelligible    how goes it  jacques     all well  jacques     touch then    they joined hands  and the man sat down on the heap of stones    no dinner     nothing but supper now   said the mender of roads  with a hungry face    it is the fashion   growled the man   i meet no dinner anywhere    he took out a blackened pipe  filled it  lighted it with flint and steel  pulled at it until it was in a bright glow  then  suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb  that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke    touch then   it was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time  after observing these operations  they again joined hands    to night   said the mender of roads    to night   said the man  putting the pipe in his mouth    where     here    he and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another  with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets  until the sky began to clear over the village    show me   said the traveller then  moving to the brow of the hill    see   returned the mender of roads  with extended finger   you go down here  and straight through the street  and past the fountain      to the devil with all that   interrupted the other  rolling his eye over the landscape   i go through no streets and past no fountains  well     well  about two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village     good  when do you cease to work     at sunset     will you wake me  before departing  i have walked two nights without resting  let me finish my pipe  and i shall sleep like a child  will you wake me     surely    the wayfarer smoked his pipe out  put it in his breast  slipped off his great wooden shoes  and lay down on his back on the heap of stones  he was fast asleep directly   as the road mender plied his dusty labour  and the hail clouds  rolling away  revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape  the little man  who wore a red cap now  in place of his blue one  seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones  his eyes were so often turned towards it  that he used his tools mechanically  and  one would have said  to very poor account  the bronze face  the shaggy black hair and beard  the coarse woollen red cap  the rough medley dress of home spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts  the powerful frame attenuated by spare living  and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep  inspired the mender of roads with awe  the traveller had travelled far  and his feet were footsore  and his ankles chafed and bleeding  his great shoes  stuffed with leaves and grass  had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues  and his clothes were chafed into holes  as he himself was into sores  stooping down beside him  the road mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not  but  in vain  for he slept with his arms crossed upon him  and set as resolutely as his lips  fortified towns with their stockades  guard houses  gates  trenches  and drawbridges  seemed to the mender of roads  to be so much air as against this figure  and when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around  he saw in his small fancy similar figures  stopped by no obstacle  tending to centres all over france   the man slept on  indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness  to sunshine on his face and shadow  to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them  until the sun was low in the west  and the sky was glowing  then  the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village  roused him    good   said the sleeper  rising on his elbow   two leagues beyond the summit of the hill     about     about  good    the mender of roads went home  with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind  and was soon at the fountain  squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink  and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village  when the village had taken its poor supper  it did not creep to bed  as it usually did  but came out of doors again  and remained there  a curious contagion of whispering was upon it  and also  when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark  another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only  monsieur gabelle  chief functionary of the place  became uneasy  went out on his house top alone  and looked in that direction too  glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below  and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church  that there might be need to ring the tocsin by and bye   the night deepened  the trees environing the old chateau  keeping its solitary state apart  moved in a rising wind  as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom  up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly  and beat at the great door  like a swift messenger rousing those within  uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall  among the old spears and knives  and passed lamenting up the stairs  and shook the curtains of the bed where the last marquis had slept  east  west  north  and south  through the woods  four heavy treading  unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches  striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard  four lights broke out there  and moved away in different directions  and all was black again   but  not for long  presently  the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own  as though it were growing luminous  then  a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front  picking out transparent places  and showing where balustrades  arches  and windows were  then it soared higher  and grew broader and brighter  soon  from a score of the great windows  flames burst forth  and the stone faces awakened  stared out of fire   a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there  and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away  there was spurring and splashing through the darkness  and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain  and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur gabelle s door   help  gabelle  help  every one   the tocsin rang impatiently  but other help  if that were any  there was none  the mender of roads  and two hundred and fifty particular friends  stood with folded arms at the fountain  looking at the pillar of fire in the sky   it must be forty feet high   said they  grimly  and never moved   the rider from the chateau  and the horse in a foam  clattered away through the village  and galloped up the stony steep  to the prison on the crag  at the gate  a group of officers were looking at the fire  removed from them  a group of soldiers   help  gentlemen  officers  the chateau is on fire  valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid  help  help   the officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire  gave no orders  and answered  with shrugs and biting of lips   it must burn    as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street  the village was illuminating  the mender of roads  and the two hundred and fifty particular friends  inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up  had darted into their houses  and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass  the general scarcity of everything  occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of monsieur gabelle  and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary s part  the mender of roads  once so submissive to authority  had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with  and that post horses would roast   the chateau was left to itself to flame and burn  in the roaring and raging of the conflagration  a red hot wind  driving straight from the infernal regions  seemed to be blowing the edifice away  with the rising and falling of the blaze  the stone faces showed as if they were in torment  when great masses of stone and timber fell  the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured  anon struggled out of the smoke again  as if it were the face of the cruel marquis  burning at the stake and contending with the fire   the chateau burned  the nearest trees  laid hold of by the fire  scorched and shrivelled  trees at a distance  fired by the four fierce figures  begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke  molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain  the water ran dry  the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat  and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame  great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls  like crystallisation  stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace  four fierce figures trudged away  east  west  north  and south  along the night enshrouded roads  guided by the beacon they had lighted  towards their next destination  the illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin  and  abolishing the lawful ringer  rang for joy   not only that  but the village  light headed with famine  fire  and bell ringing  and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes  though it was but a small instalment of taxes  and no rent at all  that gabelle had got in those latter days  became impatient for an interview with him  and  surrounding his house  summoned him to come forth for personal conference  whereupon  monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his door  and retire to hold counsel with himself  the result of that conference was  that gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys  this time resolved  if his door were broken in  he was a small southern man of retaliative temperament   to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet  and crush a man or two below   probably  monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there  with the distant chateau for fire and candle  and the beating at his door  combined with the joy ringing  for music  not to mention his having an ill omened lamp slung across the road before his posting house gate  which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour  a trying suspense  to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean  ready to take that plunge into it upon which monsieur gabelle had resolved  but  the friendly dawn appearing at last  and the rush candles of the village guttering out  the people happily dispersed  and monsieur gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while   within a hundred miles  and in the light of other fires  there were other functionaries less fortunate  that night and other nights  whom the rising sun found hanging across once peaceful streets  where they had been born and bred  also  there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows  upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success  and whom they strung up in their turn  but  the fierce figures were steadily wending east  west  north  and south  be that as it would  and whosoever hung  fire burned  the altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it  no functionary  by any stretch of mathematics  was able to calculate successfully      xxiv  drawn to the loadstone rock   in such risings of fire and risings of sea  the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb  but was always on the flow  higher and higher  to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore  three years of tempest were consumed  three more birthdays of little lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home   many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner  with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet  for  the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people  tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger  changed into wild beasts  by terrible enchantment long persisted in   monseigneur  as a class  had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated  of his being so little wanted in france  as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it  and this life together  like the fabled rustic who raised the devil with infinite pains  and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the enemy no question  but immediately fled  so  monseigneur  after boldly reading the lord s prayer backwards for a great number of years  and performing many other potent spells for compelling the evil one  no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels   the shining bull s eye of the court was gone  or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets  it had never been a good eye to see with  had long had the mote in it of lucifer s pride  sardanapalus s luxury  and a mole s blindness  but it had dropped out and was gone  the court  from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue  corruption  and dissimulation  was all gone together  royalty was gone  had been besieged in its palace and  suspended   when the last tidings came over   the august of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety two was come  and monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide   as was natural  the head quarters and great gathering place of monseigneur  in london  was tellson s bank  spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted  and monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be  moreover  it was the spot to which such french intelligence as was most to be relied upon  came quickest  again  tellson s was a munificent house  and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate  again  those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time  and anticipating plunder or confiscation  had made provident remittances to tellson s  were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren  to which it must be added that every new comer from france reported himself and his tidings at tellson s  almost as a matter of course  for such variety of reasons  tellson s was at that time  as to french intelligence  a kind of high exchange  and this was so well known to the public  and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous  that tellson s sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the bank windows  for all who ran through temple bar to read   on a steaming  misty afternoon  mr  lorry sat at his desk  and charles darnay stood leaning on it  talking with him in a low voice  the penitential den once set apart for interviews with the house  was now the news exchange  and was filled to overflowing  it was within half an hour or so of the time of closing    but  although you are the youngest man that ever lived   said charles darnay  rather hesitating   i must still suggest to you      i understand  that i am too old   said mr  lorry    unsettled weather  a long journey  uncertain means of travelling  a disorganised country  a city that may not be even safe for you     my dear charles   said mr  lorry  with cheerful confidence   you touch some of the reasons for my going  not for my staying away  it is safe enough for me  nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with  as to its being a disorganised city  if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our house here to our house there  who knows the city and the business  of old  and is in tellson s confidence  as to the uncertain travelling  the long journey  and the winter weather  if i were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of tellson s  after all these years  who ought to be     i wish i were going myself   said charles darnay  somewhat restlessly  and like one thinking aloud    indeed  you are a pretty fellow to object and advise   exclaimed mr  lorry   you wish you were going yourself  and you a frenchman born  you are a wise counsellor     my dear mr  lorry  it is because i am a frenchman born  that the thought  which i did not mean to utter here  however  has passed through my mind often  one cannot help thinking  having had some sympathy for the miserable people  and having abandoned something to them   he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner   that one might be listened to  and might have the power to persuade to some restraint  only last night  after you had left us  when i was talking to lucie      when you were talking to lucie   mr  lorry repeated   yes  i wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of lucie  wishing you were going to france at this time of day     however  i am not going   said charles darnay  with a smile   it is more to the purpose that you say you are     and i am  in plain reality  the truth is  my dear charles   mr  lorry glanced at the distant house  and lowered his voice   you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted  and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved  the lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people  if some of our documents were seized or destroyed  and they might be  at any time  you know  for who can say that paris is not set afire to day  or sacked to morrow  now  a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay  and the burying of them  or otherwise getting of them out of harm s way  is within the power  without loss of precious time  of scarcely any one but myself  if any one  and shall i hang back  when tellson s knows this and says this  tellson s  whose bread i have eaten these sixty years  because i am a little stiff about the joints  why  i am a boy  sir  to half a dozen old codgers here     how i admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit  mr  lorry     tut  nonsense  sir   and  my dear charles   said mr  lorry  glancing at the house again   you are to remember  that getting things out of paris at this present time  no matter what things  is next to an impossibility  papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here  i speak in strict confidence  it is not business like to whisper it  even to you   by the strangest bearers you can imagine  every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the barriers  at another time  our parcels would come and go  as easily as in business like old england  but now  everything is stopped     and do you really go to night     i really go to night  for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay     and do you take no one with you     all sorts of people have been proposed to me  but i will have nothing to say to any of them  i intend to take jerry  jerry has been my bodyguard on sunday nights for a long time past and i am used to him  nobody will suspect jerry of being anything but an english bull dog  or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master     i must say again that i heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness     i must say again  nonsense  nonsense  when i have executed this little commission  i shall  perhaps  accept tellson s proposal to retire and live at my ease  time enough  then  to think about growing old    this dialogue had taken place at mr  lorry s usual desk  with monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it  boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal people before long  it was too much the way of monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee  and it was much too much the way of native british orthodoxy  to talk of this terrible revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown  as if nothing had ever been done  or omitted to be done  that had led to it  as if observers of the wretched millions in france  and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous  had not seen it inevitably coming  years before  and had not in plain words recorded what they saw  such vapouring  combined with the extravagant plots of monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself  and worn out heaven and earth as well as itself  was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth  and it was such vapouring all about his ears  like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head  added to a latent uneasiness in his mind  which had already made charles darnay restless  and which still kept him so   among the talkers  was stryver  of the king s bench bar  far on his way to state promotion  and  therefore  loud on the theme  broaching to monseigneur  his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth  and doing without them  and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race  him  darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection  and darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more  and remaining to interpose his word  when the thing that was to be  went on to shape itself out   the house approached mr  lorry  and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him  asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed  the house laid the letter down so close to darnay that he saw the direction  the more quickly because it was his own right name  the address  turned into english  ran    very pressing  to monsieur heretofore the marquis st  evrémonde  of france  confided to the cares of messrs  tellson and co   bankers  london  england    on the marriage morning  doctor manette had made it his one urgent and express request to charles darnay  that the secret of this name should be  unless he  the doctor  dissolved the obligation  kept inviolate between them  nobody else knew it to be his name  his own wife had no suspicion of the fact  mr  lorry could have none    no   said mr  lorry  in reply to the house   i have referred it  i think  to everybody now here  and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found    the hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the bank  there was a general set of the current of talkers past mr  lorry s desk  he held the letter out inquiringly  and monseigneur looked at it  in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee  and monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee  and this  that  and the other  all had something disparaging to say  in french or in english  concerning the marquis who was not to be found    nephew  i believe  but in any case degenerate successor  of the polished marquis who was murdered   said one   happy to say  i never knew him     a craven who abandoned his post   said another  this monseigneur had been got out of paris  legs uppermost and half suffocated  in a load of hay   some years ago     infected with the new doctrines   said a third  eyeing the direction through his glass in passing   set himself in opposition to the last marquis  abandoned the estates when he inherited them  and left them to the ruffian herd  they will recompense him now  i hope  as he deserves     hey   cried the blatant stryver   did he though  is that the sort of fellow  let us look at his infamous name  d  n the fellow    darnay  unable to restrain himself any longer  touched mr  stryver on the shoulder  and said    i know the fellow     do you  by jupiter   said stryver   i am sorry for it     why     why  mr  darnay  d ye hear what he did  don t ask  why  in these times     but i do ask why     then i tell you again  mr  darnay  i am sorry for it  i am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions  here is a fellow  who  infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known  abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale  and you ask me why i am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him  well  but i ll answer you  i am sorry because i believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel  that s why    mindful of the secret  darnay with great difficulty checked himself  and said   you may not understand the gentleman     i understand how to put you in a corner  mr  darnay   said bully stryver   and i ll do it  if this fellow is a gentleman  i don t understand him  you may tell him so  with my compliments  you may also tell him  from me  that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob  i wonder he is not at the head of them  but  no  gentlemen   said stryver  looking all round  and snapping his fingers   i know something of human nature  and i tell you that you ll never find a fellow like this fellow  trusting himself to the mercies of such precious protégés  no  gentlemen  he ll always show  em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle  and sneak away    with those words  and a final snap of his fingers  mr  stryver shouldered himself into fleet street  amidst the general approbation of his hearers  mr  lorry and charles darnay were left alone at the desk  in the general departure from the bank    will you take charge of the letter   said mr  lorry   you know where to deliver it     i do     will you undertake to explain  that we suppose it to have been addressed here  on the chance of our knowing where to forward it  and that it has been here some time     i will do so  do you start for paris from here     from here  at eight     i will come back  to see you off    very ill at ease with himself  and with stryver and most other men  darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the temple  opened the letter  and read it  these were its contents     prison of the abbaye  paris    june      monsieur heretofore the marquis    after having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village  i have been seized  with great violence and indignity  and brought a long journey on foot to paris  on the road i have suffered a great deal  nor is that all  my house has been destroyed  razed to the ground    the crime for which i am imprisoned  monsieur heretofore the marquis  and for which i shall be summoned before the tribunal  and shall lose my life  without your so generous help   is  they tell me  treason against the majesty of the people  in that i have acted against them for an emigrant  it is in vain i represent that i have acted for them  and not against  according to your commands  it is in vain i represent that  before the sequestration of emigrant property  i had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay  that i had collected no rent  that i had had recourse to no process  the only response is  that i have acted for an emigrant  and where is that emigrant    ah  most gracious monsieur heretofore the marquis  where is that emigrant  i cry in my sleep where is he  i demand of heaven  will he not come to deliver me  no answer  ah monsieur heretofore the marquis  i send my desolate cry across the sea  hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of tilson known at paris    for the love of heaven  of justice  of generosity  of the honour of your noble name  i supplicate you  monsieur heretofore the marquis  to succour and release me  my fault is  that i have been true to you  oh monsieur heretofore the marquis  i pray you be you true to me    from this prison here of horror  whence i every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction  i send you  monsieur heretofore the marquis  the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service    your afflicted    gabelle     the latent uneasiness in darnay s mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter  the peril of an old servant and a good one  whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family  stared him so reproachfully in the face  that  as he walked to and fro in the temple considering what to do  he almost hid his face from the passersby   he knew very well  that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house  in his resentful suspicions of his uncle  and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold  he had acted imperfectly  he knew very well  that in his love for lucie  his renunciation of his social place  though by no means new to his own mind  had been hurried and incomplete  he knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it  and that he had meant to do it  and that it had never been done   the happiness of his own chosen english home  the necessity of being always actively employed  the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast  that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week  and the events of the week following made all new again  he knew very well  that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded   not without disquiet  but still without continuous and accumulating resistance  that he had watched the times for a time of action  and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by  and the nobility were trooping from france by every highway and byway  and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction  and their very names were blotting out  was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in france that might impeach him for it   but  he had oppressed no man  he had imprisoned no man  he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues  that he had relinquished them of his own will  thrown himself on a world with no favour in it  won his own private place there  and earned his own bread  monsieur gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions  to spare the people  to give them what little there was to give  such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter  and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer  and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof  for his own safety  so that it could not but appear now   this favoured the desperate resolution charles darnay had begun to make  that he would go to paris   yes  like the mariner in the old story  the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the loadstone rock  and it was drawing him to itself  and he must go  everything that arose before his mind drifted him on  faster and faster  more and more steadily  to the terrible attraction  his latent uneasiness had been  that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments  and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they  was not there  trying to do something to stay bloodshed  and assert the claims of mercy and humanity  with this uneasiness half stifled  and half reproaching him  he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong  upon that comparison  injurious to himself  had instantly followed the sneers of monseigneur  which had stung him bitterly  and those of stryver  which above all were coarse and galling  for old reasons  upon those  had followed gabelle s letter  the appeal of an innocent prisoner  in danger of death  to his justice  honour  and good name   his resolution was made  he must go to paris   yes  the loadstone rock was drawing him  and he must sail on  until he struck  he knew of no rock  he saw hardly any danger  the intention with which he had done what he had done  even although he had left it incomplete  presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in france on his presenting himself to assert it  then  that glorious vision of doing good  which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds  arose before him  and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging revolution that was running so fearfully wild   as he walked to and fro with his resolution made  he considered that neither lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone  lucie should be spared the pain of separation  and her father  always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old  should come to the knowledge of the step  as a step taken  and not in the balance of suspense and doubt  how much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father  through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of france in his mind  he did not discuss with himself  but  that circumstance too  had had its influence in his course   he walked to and fro  with thoughts very busy  until it was time to return to tellson s and take leave of mr  lorry  as soon as he arrived in paris he would present himself to this old friend  but he must say nothing of his intention now   a carriage with post horses was ready at the bank door  and jerry was booted and equipped    i have delivered that letter   said charles darnay to mr  lorry   i would not consent to your being charged with any written answer  but perhaps you will take a verbal one     that i will  and readily   said mr  lorry   if it is not dangerous     not at all  though it is to a prisoner in the abbaye     what is his name   said mr  lorry  with his open pocket book in his hand    gabelle     gabelle  and what is the message to the unfortunate gabelle in prison     simply   that he has received the letter  and will come      any time mentioned     he will start upon his journey to morrow night     any person mentioned     no    he helped mr  lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks  and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old bank  into the misty air of fleet street   my love to lucie  and to little lucie   said mr  lorry at parting   and take precious care of them till i come back    charles darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled  as the carriage rolled away   that night  it was the fourteenth of august  he sat up late  and wrote two fervent letters  one was to lucie  explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to paris  and showing her  at length  the reasons that he had  for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there  the other was to the doctor  confiding lucie and their dear child to his care  and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances  to both  he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety  immediately after his arrival   it was a hard day  that day of being among them  with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind  it was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious  but  an affectionate glance at his wife  so happy and busy  made him resolute not to tell her what impended  he had been half moved to do it  so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid   and the day passed quickly  early in the evening he embraced her  and her scarcely less dear namesake  pretending that he would return by and bye  an imaginary engagement took him out  and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready   and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets  with a heavier heart   the unseen force was drawing him fast to itself  now  and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it  he left his two letters with a trusty porter  to be delivered half an hour before midnight  and no sooner  took horse for dover  and began his journey   for the love of heaven  of justice  of generosity  of the honour of your noble name   was the poor prisoner s cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart  as he left all that was dear on earth behind him  and floated away for the loadstone rock    the end of the second book      book the third  the track of a storm     i  in secret   the traveller fared slowly on his way  who fared towards paris from england in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety two  more than enough of bad roads  bad equipages  and bad horses  he would have encountered to delay him  though the fallen and unfortunate king of france had been upon his throne in all his glory  but  the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these  every town gate and village taxing house had its band of citizen patriots  with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness  who stopped all comers and goers  cross questioned them  inspected their papers  looked for their names in lists of their own  turned them back  or sent them on  or stopped them and laid them in hold  as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning republic one and indivisible  of liberty  equality  fraternity  or death   a very few french leagues of his journey were accomplished  when charles darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at paris  whatever might befall now  he must on to his journey s end  not a mean village closed upon him  not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him  but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and england  the universal watchfulness so encompassed him  that if he had been taken in a net  or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage  he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone   this universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage  but retarded his progress twenty times in a day  by riding after him and taking him back  riding before him and stopping him by anticipation  riding with him and keeping him in charge  he had been days upon his journey in france alone  when he went to bed tired out  in a little town on the high road  still a long way from paris   nothing but the production of the afflicted gabelle s letter from his prison of the abbaye would have got him on so far  his difficulty at the guard house in this small place had been such  that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis  and he was  therefore  as little surprised as a man could be  to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning  in the middle of the night   awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths  who sat down on the bed    emigrant   said the functionary   i am going to send you on to paris  under an escort     citizen  i desire nothing more than to get to paris  though i could dispense with the escort     silence   growled a red cap  striking at the coverlet with the butt end of his musket   peace  aristocrat     it is as the good patriot says   observed the timid functionary   you are an aristocrat  and must have an escort  and must pay for it     i have no choice   said charles darnay    choice  listen to him   cried the same scowling red cap   as if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp iron     it is always as the good patriot says   observed the functionary   rise and dress yourself  emigrant    darnay complied  and was taken back to the guard house  where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking  drinking  and sleeping  by a watch fire  here he paid a heavy price for his escort  and hence he started with it on the wet  wet roads at three o clock in the morning   the escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri coloured cockades  armed with national muskets and sabres  who rode one on either side of him   the escorted governed his own horse  but a loose line was attached to his bridle  the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist  in this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces  clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement  and out upon the mire deep roads  in this state they traversed without change  except of horses and pace  all the mire deep leagues that lay between them and the capital   they travelled in the night  halting an hour or two after daybreak  and lying by until the twilight fell  the escort were so wretchedly clothed  that they twisted straw round their bare legs  and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off  apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended  and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk  and carrying his musket very recklessly  charles darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast  for  he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated  and of representations  confirmable by the prisoner in the abbaye  that were not yet made   but when they came to the town of beauvais  which they did at eventide  when the streets were filled with people  he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming  an ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting yard  and many voices called out loudly   down with the emigrant    he stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle  and  resuming it as his safest place  said    emigrant  my friends  do you not see me here  in france  of my own will     you are a cursed emigrant   cried a farrier  making at him in a furious manner through the press  hammer in hand   and you are a cursed aristocrat    the postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider s bridle  at which he was evidently making   and soothingly said   let him be  let him be  he will be judged at paris     judged   repeated the farrier  swinging his hammer   ay  and condemned as a traitor   at this the crowd roared approval   checking the postmaster  who was for turning his horse s head to the yard  the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on  with the line round his wrist   darnay said  as soon as he could make his voice heard    friends  you deceive yourselves  or you are deceived  i am not a traitor     he lies   cried the smith   he is a traitor since the decree  his life is forfeit to the people  his cursed life is not his own    at the instant when darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd  which another instant would have brought upon him  the postmaster turned his horse into the yard  the escort rode in close upon his horse s flanks  and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates  the farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer  and the crowd groaned  but  no more was done    what is this decree that the smith spoke of   darnay asked the postmaster  when he had thanked him  and stood beside him in the yard    truly  a decree for selling the property of emigrants     when passed     on the fourteenth     the day i left england     everybody says it is but one of several  and that there will be others  if there are not already  banishing all emigrants  and condemning all to death who return  that is what he meant when he said your life was not your own     but there are no such decrees yet     what do i know   said the postmaster  shrugging his shoulders   there may be  or there will be  it is all the same  what would you have    they rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night  and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep  among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal  not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep  after long and lonely spurring over dreary roads  they would come to a cluster of poor cottages  not steeped in darkness  but all glittering with lights  and would find the people  in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night  circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of liberty  or all drawn up together singing a liberty song  happily  however  there was sleep in beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness  jingling through the untimely cold and wet  among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year  diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses  and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade  and sharp reining up across their way  of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads   daylight at last found them before the wall of paris  the barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it    where are the papers of this prisoner   demanded a resolute looking man in authority  who was summoned out by the guard   naturally struck by the disagreeable word  charles darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and french citizen  in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him  and which he had paid for    where   repeated the same personage  without taking any heed of him whatever   are the papers of this prisoner    the drunken patriot had them in his cap  and produced them  casting his eyes over gabelle s letter  the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise  and looked at darnay with a close attention   he left escort and escorted without saying a word  however  and went into the guard room  meanwhile  they sat upon their horses outside the gate  looking about him while in this state of suspense  charles darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots  the latter far outnumbering the former  and that while ingress into the city for peasants  carts bringing in supplies  and for similar traffic and traffickers  was easy enough  egress  even for the homeliest people  was very difficult  a numerous medley of men and women  not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts  was waiting to issue forth  but  the previous identification was so strict  that they filtered through the barrier very slowly  some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off  that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke  while others talked together  or loitered about  the red cap and tri colour cockade were universal  both among men and women   when he had sat in his saddle some half hour  taking note of these things  darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority  who directed the guard to open the barrier  then he delivered to the escort  drunk and sober  a receipt for the escorted  and requested him to dismount  he did so  and the two patriots  leading his tired horse  turned and rode away without entering the city   he accompanied his conductor into a guard room  smelling of common wine and tobacco  where certain soldiers and patriots  asleep and awake  drunk and sober  and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking  drunkenness and sobriety  were standing and lying about  the light in the guard house  half derived from the waning oil lamps of the night  and half from the overcast day  was in a correspondingly uncertain condition  some registers were lying open on a desk  and an officer of a coarse  dark aspect  presided over these    citizen defarge   said he to darnay s conductor  as he took a slip of paper to write on   is this the emigrant evrémonde     this is the man     your age  evrémonde     thirty seven     married  evrémonde     yes     where married     in england     without doubt  where is your wife  evrémonde     in england     without doubt  you are consigned  evrémonde  to the prison of la force     just heaven   exclaimed darnay   under what law  and for what offence    the officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment    we have new laws  evrémonde  and new offences  since you were here   he said it with a hard smile  and went on writing    i entreat you to observe that i have come here voluntarily  in response to that written appeal of a fellow countryman which lies before you  i demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay  is not that my right     emigrants have no rights  evrémonde   was the stolid reply  the officer wrote until he had finished  read over to himself what he had written  sanded it  and handed it to defarge  with the words  in secret    defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him  the prisoner obeyed  and a guard of two armed patriots attended them    is it you   said defarge  in a low voice  as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into paris   who married the daughter of doctor manette  once a prisoner in the bastille that is no more     yes   replied darnay  looking at him with surprise    my name is defarge  and i keep a wine shop in the quarter saint antoine  possibly you have heard of me     my wife came to your house to reclaim her father  yes    the word  wife  seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to defarge  to say with sudden impatience   in the name of that sharp female newly born  and called la guillotine  why did you come to france     you heard me say why  a minute ago  do you not believe it is the truth     a bad truth for you   said defarge  speaking with knitted brows  and looking straight before him    indeed i am lost here  all here is so unprecedented  so changed  so sudden and unfair  that i am absolutely lost  will you render me a little help     none   defarge spoke  always looking straight before him    will you answer me a single question     perhaps  according to its nature  you can say what it is     in this prison that i am going to so unjustly  shall i have some free communication with the world outside     you will see     i am not to be buried there  prejudged  and without any means of presenting my case     you will see  but  what then  other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons  before now     but never by me  citizen defarge    defarge glanced darkly at him for answer  and walked on in a steady and set silence  the deeper he sank into this silence  the fainter hope there was  or so darnay thought  of his softening in any slight degree  he  therefore  made haste to say    it is of the utmost importance to me  you know  citizen  even better than i  of how much importance   that i should be able to communicate to mr  lorry of tellson s bank  an english gentleman who is now in paris  the simple fact  without comment  that i have been thrown into the prison of la force  will you cause that to be done for me     i will do   defarge doggedly rejoined   nothing for you  my duty is to my country and the people  i am the sworn servant of both  against you  i will do nothing for you    charles darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further  and his pride was touched besides  as they walked on in silence  he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets  the very children scarcely noticed him  a few passers turned their heads  and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat  otherwise  that a man in good clothes should be going to prison  was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work  in one narrow  dark  and dirty street through which they passed  an excited orator  mounted on a stool  was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people  of the king and the royal family  the few words that he caught from this man s lips  first made it known to charles darnay that the king was in prison  and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left paris  on the road  except at beauvais  he had heard absolutely nothing  the escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him   that he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left england  he of course knew now  that perils had thickened about him fast  and might thicken faster and faster yet  he of course knew now  he could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey  if he could have foreseen the events of a few days  and yet his misgivings were not so dark as  imagined by the light of this later time  they would appear  troubled as the future was  it was the unknown future  and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope  the horrible massacre  days and nights long  which  within a few rounds of the clock  was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest  was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away  the  sharp female newly born  and called la guillotine   was hardly known to him  or to the generality of people  by name  the frightful deeds that were to be soon done  were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers  how could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind   of unjust treatment in detention and hardship  and in cruel separation from his wife and child  he foreshadowed the likelihood  or the certainty  but  beyond this  he dreaded nothing distinctly  with this on his mind  which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard  he arrived at the prison of la force   a man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket  to whom defarge presented  the emigrant evrémonde     what the devil  how many more of them   exclaimed the man with the bloated face   defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation  and withdrew  with his two fellow patriots    what the devil  i say again   exclaimed the gaoler  left with his wife   how many more    the gaoler s wife  being provided with no answer to the question  merely replied   one must have patience  my dear   three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang  echoed the sentiment  and one added   for the love of liberty   which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion   the prison of la force was a gloomy prison  dark and filthy  and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it  extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep  becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for    in secret  too   grumbled the gaoler  looking at the written paper   as if i was not already full to bursting    he stuck the paper on a file  in an ill humour  and charles darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour  sometimes  pacing to and fro in the strong arched room  sometimes  resting on a stone seat  in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates    come   said the chief  at length taking up his keys   come with me  emigrant    through the dismal prison twilight  his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase  many doors clanging and locking behind them  until they came into a large  low  vaulted chamber  crowded with prisoners of both sexes  the women were seated at a long table  reading and writing  knitting  sewing  and embroidering  the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs  or lingering up and down the room   in the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace  the new comer recoiled from this company  but the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride  was  their all at once rising to receive him  with every refinement of manner known to the time  and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life   so strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom  so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen  that charles darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead  ghosts all  the ghost of beauty  the ghost of stateliness  the ghost of elegance  the ghost of pride  the ghost of frivolity  the ghost of wit  the ghost of youth  the ghost of age  all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore  all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there   it struck him motionless  the gaoler standing at his side  and the other gaolers moving about  who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions  looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there  with the apparitions of the coquette  the young beauty  and the mature woman delicately bred  that the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented  was heightened to its utmost  surely  ghosts all  surely  the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades    in the name of the assembled companions in misfortune   said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address  coming forward   i have the honour of giving you welcome to la force  and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us  may it soon terminate happily  it would be an impertinence elsewhere  but it is not so here  to ask your name and condition    charles darnay roused himself  and gave the required information  in words as suitable as he could find    but i hope   said the gentleman  following the chief gaoler with his eyes  who moved across the room   that you are not in secret     i do not understand the meaning of the term  but i have heard them say so     ah  what a pity  we so much regret it  but take courage  several members of our society have been in secret  at first  and it has lasted but a short time   then he added  raising his voice   i grieve to inform the society  in secret    there was a murmur of commiseration as charles darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him  and many voices  among which  the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous  gave him good wishes and encouragement  he turned at the grated door  to render the thanks of his heart  it closed under the gaoler s hand  and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever   the wicket opened on a stone staircase  leading upward  when they had ascended forty steps  the prisoner of half an hour already counted them   the gaoler opened a low black door  and they passed into a solitary cell  it struck cold and damp  but was not dark    yours   said the gaoler    why am i confined alone     how do i know     i can buy pen  ink  and paper     such are not my orders  you will be visited  and can ask then  at present  you may buy your food  and nothing more    there were in the cell  a chair  a table  and a straw mattress  as the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects  and of the four walls  before going out  a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him  that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated  both in face and person  as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water  when the gaoler was gone  he thought in the same wandering way   now am i left  as if i were dead   stopping then  to look down at the mattress  he turned from it with a sick feeling  and thought   and here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death     five paces by four and a half  five paces by four and a half  five paces by four and a half   the prisoner walked to and fro in his cell  counting its measurement  and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them   he made shoes  he made shoes  he made shoes   the prisoner counted the measurement again  and paced faster  to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition   the ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed  there was one among them  the appearance of a lady dressed in black  who was leaning in the embrasure of a window  and she had a light shining upon her golden hair  and she looked like         let us ride on again  for god s sake  through the illuminated villages with the people all awake          he made shoes  he made shoes  he made shoes          five paces by four and a half   with such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind  the prisoner walked faster and faster  obstinately counting and counting  and the roar of the city changed to this extent  that it still rolled in like muffled drums  but with the wail of voices that he knew  in the swell that rose above them      ii  the grindstone   tellson s bank  established in the saint germain quarter of paris  was in a wing of a large house  approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate  the house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles  in his own cook s dress  and got across the borders  a mere beast of the chase flying from hunters  he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same monseigneur  the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question   monseigneur gone  and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages  by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning republic one and indivisible of liberty  equality  fraternity  or death  monseigneur s house had been first sequestrated  and then confiscated  for  all things moved so fast  and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation  that now upon the third night of the autumn month of september  patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of monseigneur s house  and had marked it with the tri colour  and were drinking brandy in its state apartments   a place of business in london like tellson s place of business in paris  would soon have driven the house out of its mind and into the gazette  for  what would staid british responsibility and respectability have said to orange trees in boxes in a bank courtyard  and even to a cupid over the counter  yet such things were  tellson s had whitewashed the cupid  but he was still to be seen on the ceiling  in the coolest linen  aiming  as he very often does  at money from morning to night  bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young pagan  in lombard street  london  and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy  and also of a looking glass let into the wall  and also of clerks not at all old  who danced in public on the slightest provocation  yet  a french tellson s could get on with these things exceedingly well  and  as long as the times held together  no man had taken fright at them  and drawn out his money   what money would be drawn out of tellson s henceforth  and what would lie there  lost and forgotten  what plate and jewels would tarnish in tellson s hiding places  while the depositors rusted in prisons  and when they should have violently perished  how many accounts with tellson s never to be balanced in this world  must be carried over into the next  no man could have said  that night  any more than mr  jarvis lorry could  though he thought heavily of these questions  he sat by a newly lighted wood fire  the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold   and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw  or any object in the room distortedly reflect  a shade of horror   he occupied rooms in the bank  in his fidelity to the house of which he had grown to be a part  like strong root ivy  it chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building  but the true hearted old gentleman never calculated about that  all such circumstances were indifferent to him  so that he did his duty  on the opposite side of the courtyard  under a colonnade  was extensive standing  for carriages  where  indeed  some carriages of monseigneur yet stood  against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux  and in the light of these  standing out in the open air  was a large grindstone  a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy  or other workshop  rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects  mr  lorry shivered  and retired to his seat by the fire  he had opened  not only the glass window  but the lattice blind outside it  and he had closed both again  and he shivered through his frame   from the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate  there came the usual night hum of the city  with now and then an indescribable ring in it  weird and unearthly  as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to heaven    thank god   said mr  lorry  clasping his hands   that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to night  may he have mercy on all who are in danger    soon afterwards  the bell at the great gate sounded  and he thought   they have come back   and sat listening  but  there was no loud irruption into the courtyard  as he had expected  and he heard the gate clash again  and all was quiet   the nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the bank  which a great change would naturally awaken  with such feelings roused  it was well guarded  and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it  when his door suddenly opened  and two figures rushed in  at sight of which he fell back in amazement   lucie and her father  lucie with her arms stretched out to him  and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified  that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life    what is this   cried mr  lorry  breathless and confused   what is the matter  lucie  manette  what has happened  what has brought you here  what is it    with the look fixed upon him  in her paleness and wildness  she panted out in his arms  imploringly   o my dear friend  my husband     your husband  lucie     charles     what of charles     here    here  in paris     has been here some days  three or four  i don t know how many  i can t collect my thoughts  an errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us  he was stopped at the barrier  and sent to prison    the old man uttered an irrepressible cry  almost at the same moment  the bell of the great gate rang again  and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard    what is that noise   said the doctor  turning towards the window    don t look   cried mr  lorry   don t look out  manette  for your life  don t touch the blind    the doctor turned  with his hand upon the fastening of the window  and said  with a cool  bold smile    my dear friend  i have a charmed life in this city  i have been a bastille prisoner  there is no patriot in paris  in paris  in france  who  knowing me to have been a prisoner in the bastille  would touch me  except to overwhelm me with embraces  or carry me in triumph  my old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier  and gained us news of charles there  and brought us here  i knew it would be so  i knew i could help charles out of all danger  i told lucie so   what is that noise   his hand was again upon the window    don t look   cried mr  lorry  absolutely desperate   no  lucie  my dear  nor you   he got his arm round her  and held her   don t be so terrified  my love  i solemnly swear to you that i know of no harm having happened to charles  that i had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place  what prison is he in     la force     la force  lucie  my child  if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life  and you were always both  you will compose yourself now  to do exactly as i bid you  for more depends upon it than you can think  or i can say  there is no help for you in any action on your part to night  you cannot possibly stir out  i say this  because what i must bid you to do for charles s sake  is the hardest thing to do of all  you must instantly be obedient  still  and quiet  you must let me put you in a room at the back here  you must leave your father and me alone for two minutes  and as there are life and death in the world you must not delay     i will be submissive to you  i see in your face that you know i can do nothing else than this  i know you are true    the old man kissed her  and hurried her into his room  and turned the key  then  came hurrying back to the doctor  and opened the window and partly opened the blind  and put his hand upon the doctor s arm  and looked out with him into the courtyard   looked out upon a throng of men and women  not enough in number  or near enough  to fill the courtyard  not more than forty or fifty in all  the people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate  and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone  it had evidently been set up there for their purpose  as in a convenient and retired spot   but  such awful workers  and such awful work   the grindstone had a double handle  and  turning at it madly were two men  whose faces  as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up  were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise  false eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them  and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty  and all awry with howling  and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep  as these ruffians turned and turned  their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes  now flung backward over their necks  some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink  and what with dropping blood  and what with dropping wine  and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone  all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire  the eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood  shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening stone  were men stripped to the waist  with the stain all over their limbs and bodies  men in all sorts of rags  with the stain upon those rags  men devilishly set off with spoils of women s lace and silk and ribbon  with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through  hatchets  knives  bayonets  swords  all brought to be sharpened  were all red with it  some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them  with strips of linen and fragments of dress  ligatures various in kind  but all deep of the one colour  and as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets  the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes   eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life  to petrify with a well directed gun   all this was seen in a moment  as the vision of a drowning man  or of any human creature at any very great pass  could see a world if it were there  they drew back from the window  and the doctor looked for explanation in his friend s ashy face    they are   mr  lorry whispered the words  glancing fearfully round at the locked room   murdering the prisoners  if you are sure of what you say  if you really have the power you think you have  as i believe you have  make yourself known to these devils  and get taken to la force  it may be too late  i don t know  but let it not be a minute later    doctor manette pressed his hand  hastened bareheaded out of the room  and was in the courtyard when mr  lorry regained the blind   his streaming white hair  his remarkable face  and the impetuous confidence of his manner  as he put the weapons aside like water  carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone  for a few moments there was a pause  and a hurry  and a murmur  and the unintelligible sound of his voice  and then mr  lorry saw him  surrounded by all  and in the midst of a line of twenty men long  all linked shoulder to shoulder  and hand to shoulder  hurried out with cries of   live the bastille prisoner  help for the bastille prisoner s kindred in la force  room for the bastille prisoner in front there  save the prisoner evrémonde at la force   and a thousand answering shouts   he closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart  closed the window and the curtain  hastened to lucie  and told her that her father was assisted by the people  and gone in search of her husband  he found her child and miss pross with her  but  it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards  when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew   lucie had  by that time  fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet  clinging to his hand  miss pross had laid the child down on his own bed  and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge  o the long  long night  with the moans of the poor wife  and o the long  long night  with no return of her father and no tidings   twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded  and the irruption was repeated  and the grindstone whirled and spluttered   what is it   cried lucie  affrighted   hush  the soldiers  swords are sharpened there   said mr  lorry   the place is national property now  and used as a kind of armoury  my love    twice more in all  but  the last spell of work was feeble and fitful  soon afterwards the day began to dawn  and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand  and cautiously looked out again  a man  so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain  was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone  and looking about him with a vacant air  shortly  this worn out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of monseigneur  and  staggering to that gorgeous vehicle  climbed in at the door  and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions   the great grindstone  earth  had turned when mr  lorry looked out again  and the sun was red on the courtyard  but  the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air  with a red upon it that the sun had never given  and would never take away      iii  the shadow   one of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of mr  lorry when business hours came round  was this   that he had no right to imperil tellson s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the bank roof  his own possessions  safety  life  he would have hazarded for lucie and her child  without a moment s demur  but the great trust he held was not his own  and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business   at first  his mind reverted to defarge  and he thought of finding out the wine shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling place in the distracted state of the city  but  the same consideration that suggested him  repudiated him  he lived in the most violent quarter  and doubtless was influential there  and deep in its dangerous workings   noon coming  and the doctor not returning  and every minute s delay tending to compromise tellson s  mr  lorry advised with lucie  she said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term  in that quarter  near the banking house  as there was no business objection to this  and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with charles  and he were to be released  he could not hope to leave the city  mr  lorry went out in quest of such a lodging  and found a suitable one  high up in a removed by street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes   to this lodging he at once removed lucie and her child  and miss pross  giving them what comfort he could  and much more than he had himself  he left jerry with them  as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head  and returned to his own occupations  a disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them  and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him   it wore itself out  and wore him out with it  until the bank closed  he was again alone in his room of the previous night  considering what to do next  when he heard a foot upon the stair  in a few moments  a man stood in his presence  who  with a keenly observant look at him  addressed him by his name    your servant   said mr  lorry   do you know me    he was a strongly made man with dark curling hair  from forty five to fifty years of age  for answer he repeated  without any change of emphasis  the words    do you know me     i have seen you somewhere     perhaps at my wine shop    much interested and agitated  mr  lorry said   you come from doctor manette     yes  i come from doctor manette     and what says he  what does he send me    defarge gave into his anxious hand  an open scrap of paper  it bore the words in the doctor s writing        charles is safe  but i cannot safely leave this place yet       i have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note      from charles to his wife   let the bearer see his wife    it was dated from la force  within an hour    will you accompany me   said mr  lorry  joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud   to where his wife resides     yes   returned defarge   scarcely noticing as yet  in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way defarge spoke  mr  lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard  there  they found two women  one  knitting    madame defarge  surely   said mr  lorry  who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago    it is she   observed her husband    does madame go with us   inquired mr  lorry  seeing that she moved as they moved    yes  that she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons  it is for their safety    beginning to be struck by defarge s manner  mr  lorry looked dubiously at him  and led the way  both the women followed  the second woman being the vengeance   they passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might  ascended the staircase of the new domicile  were admitted by jerry  and found lucie weeping  alone  she was thrown into a transport by the tidings mr  lorry gave her of her husband  and clasped the hand that delivered his note  little thinking what it had been doing near him in the night  and might  but for a chance  have done to him         dearest   take courage   i am well  and your father has       influence around me   you cannot answer this        kiss our child for me    that was all the writing  it was so much  however  to her who received it  that she turned from defarge to his wife  and kissed one of the hands that knitted  it was a passionate  loving  thankful  womanly action  but the hand made no response  dropped cold and heavy  and took to its knitting again   there was something in its touch that gave lucie a check  she stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom  and  with her hands yet at her neck  looked terrified at madame defarge  madame defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold  impassive stare    my dear   said mr  lorry  striking in to explain   there are frequent risings in the streets  and  although it is not likely they will ever trouble you  madame defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times  to the end that she may know them  that she may identify them  i believe   said mr  lorry  rather halting in his reassuring words  as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more   i state the case  citizen defarge    defarge looked gloomily at his wife  and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence    you had better  lucie   said mr  lorry  doing all he could to propitiate  by tone and manner   have the dear child here  and our good pross  our good pross  defarge  is an english lady  and knows no french    the lady in question  whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner  was not to be shaken by distress and  danger  appeared with folded arms  and observed in english to the vengeance  whom her eyes first encountered   well  i am sure  boldface  i hope you are pretty well   she also bestowed a british cough on madame defarge  but  neither of the two took much heed of her    is that his child   said madame defarge  stopping in her work for the first time  and pointing her knitting needle at little lucie as if it were the finger of fate    yes  madame   answered mr  lorry   this is our poor prisoner s darling daughter  and only child    the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child  that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her  and held her to her breast  the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed then to fall  threatening and dark  on both the mother and the child    it is enough  my husband   said madame defarge   i have seen them  we may go    but  the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it  not visible and presented  but indistinct and withheld  to alarm lucie into saying  as she laid her appealing hand on madame defarge s dress    you will be good to my poor husband  you will do him no harm  you will help me to see him if you can     your husband is not my business here   returned madame defarge  looking down at her with perfect composure   it is the daughter of your father who is my business here     for my sake  then  be merciful to my husband  for my child s sake  she will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful  we are more afraid of you than of these others    madame defarge received it as a compliment  and looked at her husband  defarge  who had been uneasily biting his thumb nail and looking at her  collected his face into a sterner expression    what is it that your husband says in that little letter   asked madame defarge  with a lowering smile   influence  he says something touching influence     that my father   said lucie  hurriedly taking the paper from her breast  but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it   has much influence around him     surely it will release him   said madame defarge   let it do so     as a wife and mother   cried lucie  most earnestly   i implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess  against my innocent husband  but to use it in his behalf  o sister woman  think of me  as a wife and mother    madame defarge looked  coldly as ever  at the suppliant  and said  turning to her friend the vengeance    the wives and mothers we have been used to see  since we were as little as this child  and much less  have not been greatly considered  we have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them  often enough  all our lives  we have seen our sister women suffer  in themselves and in their children  poverty  nakedness  hunger  thirst  sickness  misery  oppression and neglect of all kinds     we have seen nothing else   returned the vengeance    we have borne this a long time   said madame defarge  turning her eyes again upon lucie   judge you  is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now    she resumed her knitting and went out  the vengeance followed  defarge went last  and closed the door    courage  my dear lucie   said mr  lorry  as he raised her   courage  courage  so far all goes well with us  much  much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls  cheer up  and have a thankful heart     i am not thankless  i hope  but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes     tut  tut   said mr  lorry   what is this despondency in the brave little breast  a shadow indeed  no substance in it  lucie    but the shadow of the manner of these defarges was dark upon himself  for all that  and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly      iv  calm in storm   doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence  so much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of lucie was so well concealed from her  that not until long afterwards  when france and she were far apart  did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace  that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror  and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain  she only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons  that all political prisoners had been in danger  and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered   to mr  lorry  the doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell  that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of la force  that  in the prison he had found a self appointed tribunal sitting  before which the prisoners were brought singly  and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred  or to be released  or  in a few cases  to be sent back to their cells  that  presented by his conductors to this tribunal  he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the bastille  that  one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him  and that this man was defarge   that  hereupon he had ascertained  through the registers on the table  that his son in law was among the living prisoners  and had pleaded hard to the tribunal  of whom some members were asleep and some awake  some dirty with murder and some clean  some sober and some not  for his life and liberty  that  in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system  it had been accorded to him to have charles darnay brought before the lawless court  and examined  that  he seemed on the point of being at once released  when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check  not intelligible to the doctor   which led to a few words of secret conference  that  the man sitting as president had then informed doctor manette that the prisoner must remain in custody  but should  for his sake  be held inviolate in safe custody  that  immediately  on a signal  the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again  but  that he  the doctor  had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son in law was  through no malice or mischance  delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings  that he had obtained the permission  and had remained in that hall of blood until the danger was over   the sights he had seen there  with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals  shall remain untold  the mad joy over the prisoners who were saved  had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces  one prisoner there was  he said  who had been discharged into the street free  but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out  being besought to go to him and dress the wound  the doctor had passed out at the same gate  and had found him in the arms of a company of samaritans  who were seated on the bodies of their victims  with an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare  they had helped the healer  and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude  had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spot  had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful  that the doctor had covered his eyes with his hands  and swooned away in the midst of it   as mr  lorry received these confidences  and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty two years of age  a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger   but  he had never seen his friend in his present aspect  he had never at all known him in his present character  for the first time the doctor felt  now  that his suffering was strength and power  for the first time he felt that in that sharp fire  he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter s husband  and deliver him   it all tended to a good end  my friend  it was not mere waste and ruin  as my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself  i will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her  by the aid of heaven i will do it   thus  doctor manette  and when jarvis lorry saw the kindled eyes  the resolute face  the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped  like a clock  for so many years  and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness  he believed   greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend with  would have yielded before his persevering purpose  while he kept himself in his place  as a physician  whose business was with all degrees of mankind  bond and free  rich and poor  bad and good  he used his personal influence so wisely  that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons  and among them of la force  he could now assure lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone  but was mixed with the general body of prisoners  he saw her husband weekly  and brought sweet messages to her  straight from his lips  sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her  though never by the doctor s hand   but she was not permitted to write to him  for  among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons  the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad   this new life of the doctor s was an anxious life  no doubt  still  the sagacious mr  lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it  nothing unbecoming tinged the pride  it was a natural and worthy one  but he observed it as a curiosity  the doctor knew  that up to that time  his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend  with his personal affliction  deprivation  and weakness  now that this was changed  and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for charles s ultimate safety and deliverance  he became so far exalted by the change  that he took the lead and direction  and required them as the weak  to trust to him as the strong  the preceding relative positions of himself and lucie were reversed  yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them  for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him   all curious to see   thought mr  lorry  in his amiably shrewd way   but all natural and right  so  take the lead  my dear friend  and keep it  it couldn t be in better hands    but  though the doctor tried hard  and never ceased trying  to get charles darnay set at liberty  or at least to get him brought to trial  the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him  the new era began  the king was tried  doomed  and beheaded  the republic of liberty  equality  fraternity  or death  declared for victory or death against the world in arms  the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of notre dame  three hundred thousand men  summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth  rose from all the varying soils of france  as if the dragon s teeth had been sown broadcast  and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain  on rock  in gravel  and alluvial mud  under the bright sky of the south and under the clouds of the north  in fell and forest  in the vineyards and the olive grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn  along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers  and in the sand of the sea shore  what private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the year one of liberty  the deluge rising from below  not falling from above  and with the windows of heaven shut  not opened   there was no pause  no pity  no peace  no interval of relenting rest  no measurement of time  though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young  and the evening and morning were the first day  other count of time there was none  hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation  as it is in the fever of one patient  now  breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city  the executioner showed the people the head of the king  and now  it seemed almost in the same breath  the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery  to turn it grey   and yet  observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases  the time was long  while it flamed by so fast  a revolutionary tribunal in the capital  and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land  a law of the suspected  which struck away all security for liberty or life  and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one  prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence  and could obtain no hearing  these things became the established order and nature of appointed things  and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old  above all  one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the world  the figure of the sharp female called la guillotine   it was the popular theme for jests  it was the best cure for headache  it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey  it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion  it was the national razor which shaved close  who kissed la guillotine  looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack  it was the sign of the regeneration of the human race  it superseded the cross  models of it were worn on breasts from which the cross was discarded  and it was bowed down to and believed in where the cross was denied   it sheared off heads so many  that it  and the ground it most polluted  were a rotten red  it was taken to pieces  like a toy puzzle for a young devil  and was put together again when the occasion wanted it  it hushed the eloquent  struck down the powerful  abolished the beautiful and good  twenty two friends of high public mark  twenty one living and one dead  it had lopped the heads off  in one morning  in as many minutes  the name of the strong man of old scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it  but  so armed  he was stronger than his namesake  and blinder  and tore away the gates of god s own temple every day   among these terrors  and the brood belonging to them  the doctor walked with a steady head  confident in his power  cautiously persistent in his end  never doubting that he would save lucie s husband at last  yet the current of the time swept by  so strong and deep  and carried the time away so fiercely  that charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the doctor was thus steady and confident  so much more wicked and distracted had the revolution grown in that december month  that the rivers of the south were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night  and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun  still  the doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head  no man better known than he  in paris at that day  no man in a stranger situation  silent  humane  indispensable in hospital and prison  using his art equally among assassins and victims  he was a man apart  in the exercise of his skill  the appearance and the story of the bastille captive removed him from all other men  he was not suspected or brought in question  any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before  or were a spirit moving among mortals      v  the wood sawyer   one year and three months  during all that time lucie was never sure  from hour to hour  but that the guillotine would strike off her husband s head next day  every day  through the stony streets  the tumbrils now jolted heavily  filled with condemned  lovely girls  bright women  brown haired  black haired  and grey  youths  stalwart men and old  gentle born and peasant born  all red wine for la guillotine  all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons  and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst  liberty  equality  fraternity  or death   the last  much the easiest to bestow  o guillotine   if the suddenness of her calamity  and the whirling wheels of the time  had stunned the doctor s daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair  it would but have been with her as it was with many  but  from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of saint antoine  she had been true to her duties  she was truest to them in the season of trial  as all the quietly loyal and good will always be   as soon as they were established in their new residence  and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations  she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there  everything had its appointed place and its appointed time  little lucie she taught  as regularly  as if they had all been united in their english home  the slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunited  the little preparations for his speedy return  the setting aside of his chair and his books  these  and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially  among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death  were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind   she did not greatly alter in appearance  the plain dark dresses  akin to mourning dresses  which she and her child wore  were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days  she lost her colour  and the old and intent expression was a constant  not an occasional  thing  otherwise  she remained very pretty and comely  sometimes  at night on kissing her father  she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day  and would say that her sole reliance  under heaven  was on him  he always resolutely answered   nothing can happen to him without my knowledge  and i know that i can save him  lucie    they had not made the round of their changed life many weeks  when her father said to her  on coming home one evening    my dear  there is an upper window in the prison  to which charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon  when he can get to it  which depends on many uncertainties and incidents  he might see you in the street  he thinks  if you stood in a certain place that i can show you  but you will not be able to see him  my poor child  and even if you could  it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition     o show me the place  my father  and i will go there every day    from that time  in all weathers  she waited there two hours  as the clock struck two  she was there  and at four she turned resignedly away  when it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her  they went together  at other times she was alone  but  she never missed a single day   it was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street  the hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning  was the only house at that end  all else was wall  on the third day of her being there  he noticed her    good day  citizeness     good day  citizen    this mode of address was now prescribed by decree  it had been established voluntarily some time ago  among the more thorough patriots  but  was now law for everybody    walking here again  citizeness     you see me  citizen    the wood sawyer  who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture  he had once been a mender of roads   cast a glance at the prison  pointed at the prison  and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars  peeped through them jocosely    but it s not my business   said he  and went on sawing his wood   next day he was looking out for her  and accosted her the moment she appeared    what  walking here again  citizeness     yes  citizen     ah  a child too  your mother  is it not  my little citizeness     do i say yes  mamma   whispered little lucie  drawing close to her    yes  dearest     yes  citizen     ah  but it s not my business  my work is my business  see my saw  i call it my little guillotine  la  la  la  la  la  la  and off his head comes    the billet fell as he spoke  and he threw it into a basket    i call myself the samson of the firewood guillotine  see here again  loo  loo  loo  loo  loo  loo  and off her head comes  now  a child  tickle  tickle  pickle  pickle  and off its head comes  all the family    lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket  but it was impossible to be there while the wood sawyer was at work  and not be in his sight  thenceforth  to secure his good will  she always spoke to him first  and often gave him drink money  which he readily received   he was an inquisitive fellow  and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates  and in lifting her heart up to her husband  she would come to herself to find him looking at her  with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work   but it s not my business   he would generally say at those times  and would briskly fall to his sawing again   in all weathers  in the snow and frost of winter  in the bitter winds of spring  in the hot sunshine of summer  in the rains of autumn  and again in the snow and frost of winter  lucie passed two hours of every day at this place  and every day on leaving it  she kissed the prison wall  her husband saw her  so she learned from her father  it might be once in five or six times  it might be twice or thrice running  it might be  not for a week or a fortnight together  it was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served  and on that possibility she would have waited out the day  seven days a week   these occupations brought her round to the december month  wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head  on a lightly snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner  it was a day of some wild rejoicing  and a festival  she had seen the houses  as she came along  decorated with little pikes  and with little red caps stuck upon them  also  with tricoloured ribbons  also  with the standard inscription  tricoloured letters were the favourite   republic one and indivisible  liberty  equality  fraternity  or death   the miserable shop of the wood sawyer was so small  that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend  he had got somebody to scrawl it up for him  however  who had squeezed death in with most inappropriate difficulty  on his house top  he displayed pike and cap  as a good citizen must  and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his  little sainte guillotine   for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised  his shop was shut and he was not there  which was a relief to lucie  and left her quite alone   but  he was not far off  for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along  which filled her with fear  a moment afterwards  and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall  in the midst of whom was the wood sawyer hand in hand with the vengeance  there could not be fewer than five hundred people  and they were dancing like five thousand demons  there was no other music than their own singing  they danced to the popular revolution song  keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison  men and women danced together  women danced together  men danced together  as hazard had brought them together  at first  they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags  but  as they filled the place  and stopped to dance about lucie  some ghastly apparition of a dance figure gone raving mad arose among them  they advanced  retreated  struck at one another s hands  clutched at one another s heads  spun round alone  caught one another and spun round in pairs  until many of them dropped  while those were down  the rest linked hand in hand  and all spun round together  then the ring broke  and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once  began again  struck  clutched  and tore  and then reversed the spin  and all spun round another way  suddenly they stopped again  paused  struck out the time afresh  formed into lines the width of the public way  and  with their heads low down and their hands high up  swooped screaming off  no fight could have been half so terrible as this dance  it was so emphatically a fallen sport  a something  once innocent  delivered over to all devilry  a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood  bewildering the senses  and steeling the heart  such grace as was visible in it  made it the uglier  showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become  the maidenly bosom bared to this  the pretty almost child s head thus distracted  the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt  were types of the disjointed time   this was the carmagnole  as it passed  leaving lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the wood sawyer s house  the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft  as if it had never been    o my father   for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand   such a cruel  bad sight     i know  my dear  i know  i have seen it many times  don t be frightened  not one of them would harm you     i am not frightened for myself  my father  but when i think of my husband  and the mercies of these people      we will set him above their mercies very soon  i left him climbing to the window  and i came to tell you  there is no one here to see  you may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof     i do so  father  and i send him my soul with it     you cannot see him  my poor dear     no  father   said lucie  yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand   no    a footstep in the snow  madame defarge   i salute you  citizeness    from the doctor   i salute you  citizen   this in passing  nothing more  madame defarge gone  like a shadow over the white road    give me your arm  my love  pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage  for his sake  that was well done   they had left the spot   it shall not be in vain  charles is summoned for to morrow     for to morrow     there is no time to lose  i am well prepared  but there are precautions to be taken  that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the tribunal  he has not received the notice yet  but i know that he will presently be summoned for to morrow  and removed to the conciergerie  i have timely information  you are not afraid    she could scarcely answer   i trust in you     do so  implicitly  your suspense is nearly ended  my darling  he shall be restored to you within a few hours  i have encompassed him with every protection  i must see lorry    he stopped  there was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing  they both knew too well what it meant  one  two  three  three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow    i must see lorry   the doctor repeated  turning her another way   the staunch old gentleman was still in his trust  had never left it  he and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national  what he could save for the owners  he saved  no better man living to hold fast by what tellson s had in keeping  and to hold his peace   a murky red and yellow sky  and a rising mist from the seine  denoted the approach of darkness  it was almost dark when they arrived at the bank  the stately residence of monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted  above a heap of dust and ashes in the court  ran the letters  national property  republic one and indivisible  liberty  equality  fraternity  or death   who could that be with mr  lorry  the owner of the riding coat upon the chair  who must not be seen  from whom newly arrived  did he come out  agitated and surprised  to take his favourite in his arms  to whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words  when  raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued  he said   removed to the conciergerie  and summoned for to morrow       vi  triumph   the dread tribunal of five judges  public prosecutor  and determined jury  sat every day  their lists went forth every evening  and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners  the standard gaoler joke was   come out and listen to the evening paper  you inside there     charles evrémonde  called darnay    so at last began the evening paper at la force   when a name was called  its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded  charles evrémonde  called darnay  had reason to know the usage  he had seen hundreds pass away so   his bloated gaoler  who wore spectacles to read with  glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place  and went through the list  making a similar short pause at each name  there were twenty three names  but only twenty were responded to  for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten  and two had already been guillotined and forgotten  the list was read  in the vaulted chamber where darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival  every one of those had perished in the massacre  every human creature he had since cared for and parted with  had died on the scaffold   there were hurried words of farewell and kindness  but the parting was soon over  it was the incident of every day  and the society of la force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert  for that evening  they crowded to the grates and shed tears there  but  twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled  and the time was  at best  short to the lock up hour  when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night  the prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling  their ways arose out of the condition of the time  similarly  though with a subtle difference  a species of fervour or intoxication  known  without doubt  to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily  and to die by it  was not mere boastfulness  but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind  in seasons of pestilence  some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease  a terrible passing inclination to die of it  and all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts  only needing circumstances to evoke them   the passage to the conciergerie was short and dark  the night in its vermin haunted cells was long and cold  next day  fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before charles darnay s name was called  all the fifteen were condemned  and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half    charles evrémonde  called darnay   was at length arraigned   his judges sat upon the bench in feathered hats  but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head dress otherwise prevailing  looking at the jury and the turbulent audience  he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed  and that the felons were trying the honest men  the lowest  cruelest  and worst populace of a city  never without its quantity of low  cruel  and bad  were the directing spirits of the scene  noisily commenting  applauding  disapproving  anticipating  and precipitating the result  without a check  of the men  the greater part were armed in various ways  of the women  some wore knives  some daggers  some ate and drank as they looked on  many knitted  among these last  was one  with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked  she was in a front row  by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the barrier  but whom he directly remembered as defarge  he noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear  and that she seemed to be his wife  but  what he most noticed in the two figures was  that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be  they never looked towards him  they seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination  and they looked at the jury  but at nothing else  under the president sat doctor manette  in his usual quiet dress  as well as the prisoner could see  he and mr  lorry were the only men there  unconnected with the tribunal  who wore their usual clothes  and had not assumed the coarse garb of the carmagnole   charles evrémonde  called darnay  was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant  whose life was forfeit to the republic  under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of death  it was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to france  there he was  and there was the decree  he had been taken in france  and his head was demanded    take off his head   cried the audience   an enemy to the republic    the president rang his bell to silence those cries  and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in england   undoubtedly it was   was he not an emigrant then  what did he call himself   not an emigrant  he hoped  within the sense and spirit of the law   why not  the president desired to know   because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him  and a station that was distasteful to him  and had left his country  he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the tribunal was in use  to live by his own industry in england  rather than on the industry of the overladen people of france   what proof had he of this   he handed in the names of two witnesses  theophile gabelle  and alexandre manette   but he had married in england  the president reminded him   true  but not an english woman   a citizeness of france   yes  by birth   her name and family    lucie manette  only daughter of doctor manette  the good physician who sits there    this answer had a happy effect upon the audience  cries in exaltation of the well known good physician rent the hall  so capriciously were the people moved  that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before  as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him   on these few steps of his dangerous way  charles darnay had set his foot according to doctor manette s reiterated instructions  the same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him  and had prepared every inch of his road   the president asked  why had he returned to france when he did  and not sooner   he had not returned sooner  he replied  simply because he had no means of living in france  save those he had resigned  whereas  in england  he lived by giving instruction in the french language and literature  he had returned when he did  on the pressing and written entreaty of a french citizen  who represented that his life was endangered by his absence  he had come back  to save a citizen s life  and to bear his testimony  at whatever personal hazard  to the truth  was that criminal in the eyes of the republic   the populace cried enthusiastically   no   and the president rang his bell to quiet them  which it did not  for they continued to cry  no    until they left off  of their own will   the president required the name of that citizen  the accused explained that the citizen was his first witness  he also referred with confidence to the citizen s letter  which had been taken from him at the barrier  but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the president   the doctor had taken care that it should be there  had assured him that it would be there  and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read  citizen gabelle was called to confirm it  and did so  citizen gabelle hinted  with infinite delicacy and politeness  that in the pressure of business imposed on the tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the republic with which it had to deal  he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the abbaye  in fact  had rather passed out of the tribunal s patriotic remembrance  until three days ago  when he had been summoned before it  and had been set at liberty on the jury s declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered  as to himself  by the surrender of the citizen evrémonde  called darnay   doctor manette was next questioned  his high personal popularity  and the clearness of his answers  made a great impression  but  as he proceeded  as he showed that the accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment  that  the accused had remained in england  always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile  that  so far from being in favour with the aristocrat government there  he had actually been tried for his life by it  as the foe of england and friend of the united states  as he brought these circumstances into view  with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness  the jury and the populace became one  at last  when he appealed by name to monsieur lorry  an english gentleman then and there present  who  like himself  had been a witness on that english trial and could corroborate his account of it  the jury declared that they had heard enough  and that they were ready with their votes if the president were content to receive them   at every vote  the jurymen voted aloud and individually   the populace set up a shout of applause  all the voices were in the prisoner s favour  and the president declared him free   then  began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness  or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy  or which they regarded as some set off against their swollen account of cruel rage  no man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable  it is probable  to a blending of all the three  with the second predominating  no sooner was the acquittal pronounced  than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time  and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him  that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion  none the less because he knew very well  that the very same people  carried by another current  would have rushed at him with the very same intensity  to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets   his removal  to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried  rescued him from these caresses for the moment  five were to be tried together  next  as enemies of the republic  forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed  so quick was the tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost  that these five came down to him before he left the place  condemned to die within twenty four hours  the first of them told him so  with the customary prison sign of death  a raised finger  and they all added in words   long live the republic    the five had had  it is true  no audience to lengthen their proceedings  for when he and doctor manette emerged from the gate  there was a great crowd about it  in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in court  except two  for which he looked in vain  on his coming out  the concourse made at him anew  weeping  embracing  and shouting  all by turns and all together  until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted  seemed to run mad  like the people on the shore   they put him into a great chair they had among them  and which they had taken either out of the court itself  or one of its rooms or passages  over the chair they had thrown a red flag  and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top  in this car of triumph  not even the doctor s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men s shoulders  with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him  and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces  that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion  and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the guillotine   in wild dreamlike procession  embracing whom they met and pointing him out  they carried him on  reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing republican colour  in winding and tramping through them  as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye  they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived  her father had gone on before  to prepare her  and when her husband stood upon his feet  she dropped insensible in his arms   as he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd  so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen  a few of the people fell to dancing  instantly  all the rest fell to dancing  and the courtyard overflowed with the carmagnole  then  they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the goddess of liberty  and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets  and along the river s bank  and over the bridge  the carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away   after grasping the doctor s hand  as he stood victorious and proud before him  after grasping the hand of mr  lorry  who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the carmagnole  after kissing little lucie  who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck  and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful pross who lifted her  he took his wife in his arms  and carried her up to their rooms    lucie  my own  i am safe     o dearest charles  let me thank god for this on my knees as i have prayed to him    they all reverently bowed their heads and hearts  when she was again in his arms  he said to her    and now speak to your father  dearest  no other man in all this france could have done what he has done for me    she laid her head upon her father s breast  as she had laid his poor head on her own breast  long  long ago  he was happy in the return he had made her  he was recompensed for his suffering  he was proud of his strength   you must not be weak  my darling   he remonstrated   don t tremble so  i have saved him       vii  a knock at the door    i have saved him   it was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back  he was really here  and yet his wife trembled  and a vague but heavy fear was upon her   all the air round was so thick and dark  the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful  the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice  it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her  every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched  that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be  the shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall  and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets  her mind pursued them  looking for him among the condemned  and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more   her father  cheering her  showed a compassionate superiority to this woman s weakness  which was wonderful to see  no garret  no shoemaking  no one hundred and five  north tower  now  he had accomplished the task he had set himself  his promise was redeemed  he had saved charles  let them all lean upon him   their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind  not only because that was the safest way of life  involving the least offence to the people  but because they were not rich  and charles  throughout his imprisonment  had had to pay heavily for his bad food  and for his guard  and towards the living of the poorer prisoners  partly on this account  and partly to avoid a domestic spy  they kept no servant  the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate  rendered them occasional service  and jerry  almost wholly transferred to them by mr  lorry  had become their daily retainer  and had his bed there every night   it was an ordinance of the republic one and indivisible of liberty  equality  fraternity  or death  that on the door or doorpost of every house  the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size  at a certain convenient height from the ground  mr  jerry cruncher s name  therefore  duly embellished the doorpost down below  and  as the afternoon shadows deepened  the owner of that name himself appeared  from overlooking a painter whom doctor manette had employed to add to the list the name of charles evrémonde  called darnay   in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time  all the usual harmless ways of life were changed  in the doctor s little household  as in very many others  the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening  in small quantities and at various small shops  to avoid attracting notice  and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy  was the general desire   for some months past  miss pross and mr  cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors  the former carrying the money  the latter  the basket  every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted  they fared forth on this duty  and made and brought home such purchases as were needful  although miss pross  through her long association with a french family  might have known as much of their language as of her own  if she had had a mind  she had no mind in that direction  consequently she knew no more of that  nonsense   as she was pleased to call it  than mr  cruncher did  so her manner of marketing was to plump a noun substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article  and  if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted  to look round for that thing  lay hold of it  and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded  she always made a bargain for it  by holding up  as a statement of its just price  one finger less than the merchant held up  whatever his number might be    now  mr  cruncher   said miss pross  whose eyes were red with felicity   if you are ready  i am    jerry hoarsely professed himself at miss pross s service  he had worn all his rust off long ago  but nothing would file his spiky head down    there s all manner of things wanted   said miss pross   and we shall have a precious time of it  we want wine  among the rest  nice toasts these redheads will be drinking  wherever we buy it     it will be much the same to your knowledge  miss  i should think    retorted jerry   whether they drink your health or the old un s     who s he   said miss pross   mr  cruncher  with some diffidence  explained himself as meaning  old nick s     ha   said miss pross   it doesn t need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures  they have but one  and it s midnight murder  and mischief     hush  dear  pray  pray  be cautious   cried lucie    yes  yes  yes  i ll be cautious   said miss pross   but i may say among ourselves  that i do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round  going on in the streets  now  ladybird  never you stir from that fire till i come back  take care of the dear husband you have recovered  and don t move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now  till you see me again  may i ask a question  doctor manette  before i go     i think you may take that liberty   the doctor answered  smiling    for gracious sake  don t talk about liberty  we have quite enough of that   said miss pross    hush  dear  again   lucie remonstrated    well  my sweet   said miss pross  nodding her head emphatically   the short and the long of it is  that i am a subject of his most gracious majesty king george the third   miss pross curtseyed at the name   and as such  my maxim is  confound their politics  frustrate their knavish tricks  on him our hopes we fix  god save the king    mr  cruncher  in an access of loyalty  growlingly repeated the words after miss pross  like somebody at church    i am glad you have so much of the englishman in you  though i wish you had never taken that cold in your voice   said miss pross  approvingly   but the question  doctor manette  is there   it was the good creature s way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all  and to come at it in this chance manner   is there any prospect yet  of our getting out of this place     i fear not yet  it would be dangerous for charles yet     heigh ho hum   said miss pross  cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling s golden hair in the light of the fire   then we must have patience and wait  that s all  we must hold up our heads and fight low  as my brother solomon used to say  now  mr  cruncher   don t you move  ladybird    they went out  leaving lucie  and her husband  her father  and the child  by a bright fire  mr  lorry was expected back presently from the banking house  miss pross had lighted the lamp  but had put it aside in a corner  that they might enjoy the fire light undisturbed  little lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm  and he  in a tone not rising much above a whisper  began to tell her a story of a great and powerful fairy who had opened a prison wall and let out a captive who had once done the fairy a service  all was subdued and quiet  and lucie was more at ease than she had been    what is that   she cried  all at once    my dear   said her father  stopping in his story  and laying his hand on hers   command yourself  what a disordered state you are in  the least thing  nothing  startles you  you  your father s daughter     i thought  my father   said lucie  excusing herself  with a pale face and in a faltering voice   that i heard strange feet upon the stairs     my love  the staircase is as still as death    as he said the word  a blow was struck upon the door    oh father  father  what can this be  hide charles  save him     my child   said the doctor  rising  and laying his hand upon her shoulder   i have saved him  what weakness is this  my dear  let me go to the door    he took the lamp in his hand  crossed the two intervening outer rooms  and opened it  a rude clattering of feet over the floor  and four rough men in red caps  armed with sabres and pistols  entered the room    the citizen evrémonde  called darnay   said the first    who seeks him   answered darnay    i seek him  we seek him  i know you  evrémonde  i saw you before the tribunal to day  you are again the prisoner of the republic    the four surrounded him  where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him    tell me how and why am i again a prisoner     it is enough that you return straight to the conciergerie  and will know to morrow  you are summoned for to morrow    doctor manette  whom this visitation had so turned into stone  that he stood with the lamp in his hand  as if he were a statue made to hold it  moved after these words were spoken  put the lamp down  and confronting the speaker  and taking him  not ungently  by the loose front of his red woollen shirt  said    you know him  you have said  do you know me     yes  i know you  citizen doctor     we all know you  citizen doctor   said the other three   he looked abstractedly from one to another  and said  in a lower voice  after a pause    will you answer his question to me then  how does this happen     citizen doctor   said the first  reluctantly   he has been denounced to the section of saint antoine  this citizen   pointing out the second who had entered   is from saint antoine    the citizen here indicated nodded his head  and added    he is accused by saint antoine     of what   asked the doctor    citizen doctor   said the first  with his former reluctance   ask no more  if the republic demands sacrifices from you  without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them  the republic goes before all  the people is supreme  evrémonde  we are pressed     one word   the doctor entreated   will you tell me who denounced him     it is against rule   answered the first   but you can ask him of saint antoine here    the doctor turned his eyes upon that man  who moved uneasily on his feet  rubbed his beard a little  and at length said    well  truly it is against rule  but he is denounced  and gravely  by the citizen and citizeness defarge  and by one other     what other     do you ask  citizen doctor     yes     then   said he of saint antoine  with a strange look   you will be answered to morrow  now  i am dumb       viii  a hand at cards   happily unconscious of the new calamity at home  miss pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the pont neuf  reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make  mr  cruncher  with the basket  walked at her side  they both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed  had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people  and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers  it was a raw evening  and the misty river  blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises  showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked  making guns for the army of the republic  woe to the man who played tricks with that army  or got undeserved promotion in it  better for him that his beard had never grown  for the national razor shaved him close   having purchased a few small articles of grocery  and a measure of oil for the lamp  miss pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted  after peeping into several wine shops  she stopped at the sign of the good republican brutus of antiquity  not far from the national palace  once  and twice  the tuileries  where the aspect of things rather took her fancy  it had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed  and  though red with patriotic caps  was not so red as the rest  sounding mr  cruncher  and finding him of her opinion  miss pross resorted to the good republican brutus of antiquity  attended by her cavalier   slightly observant of the smoky lights  of the people  pipe in mouth  playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes  of the one bare breasted  bare armed  soot begrimed workman reading a journal aloud  and of the others listening to him  of the weapons worn  or laid aside to be resumed  of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep  who in the popular high shouldered shaggy black spencer looked  in that attitude  like slumbering bears or dogs  the two outlandish customers approached the counter  and showed what they wanted   as their wine was measuring out  a man parted from another man in a corner  and rose to depart  in going  he had to face miss pross  no sooner did he face her  than miss pross uttered a scream  and clapped her hands   in a moment  the whole company were on their feet  that somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence  everybody looked to see somebody fall  but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other  the man with all the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thorough republican  the woman  evidently english   what was said in this disappointing anti climax  by the disciples of the good republican brutus of antiquity  except that it was something very voluble and loud  would have been as so much hebrew or chaldean to miss pross and her protector  though they had been all ears  but  they had no ears for anything in their surprise  for  it must be recorded  that not only was miss pross lost in amazement and agitation  but  mr  cruncher  though it seemed on his own separate and individual account  was in a state of the greatest wonder    what is the matter   said the man who had caused miss pross to scream  speaking in a vexed  abrupt voice  though in a low tone   and in english    oh  solomon  dear solomon   cried miss pross  clapping her hands again   after not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time  do i find you here     don t call me solomon  do you want to be the death of me   asked the man  in a furtive  frightened way    brother  brother   cried miss pross  bursting into tears   have i ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question     then hold your meddlesome tongue   said solomon   and come out  if you want to speak to me  pay for your wine  and come out  who s this man    miss pross  shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother  said through her tears   mr  cruncher     let him come out too   said solomon   does he think me a ghost    apparently  mr  cruncher did  to judge from his looks  he said not a word  however  and miss pross  exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine  as she did so  solomon turned to the followers of the good republican brutus of antiquity  and offered a few words of explanation in the french language  which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits    now   said solomon  stopping at the dark street corner   what do you want     how dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from   cried miss pross   to give me such a greeting  and show me no affection     there  confound it  there   said solomon  making a dab at miss pross s lips with his own   now are you content    miss pross only shook her head and wept in silence    if you expect me to be surprised   said her brother solomon   i am not surprised  i knew you were here  i know of most people who are here  if you really don t want to endanger my existence  which i half believe you do  go your ways as soon as possible  and let me go mine  i am busy  i am an official     my english brother solomon   mourned miss pross  casting up her tear fraught eyes   that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country  an official among foreigners  and such foreigners  i would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his      i said so   cried her brother  interrupting   i knew it  you want to be the death of me  i shall be rendered suspected  by my own sister  just as i am getting on     the gracious and merciful heavens forbid   cried miss pross   far rather would i never see you again  dear solomon  though i have ever loved you truly  and ever shall  say but one affectionate word to me  and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us  and i will detain you no longer    good miss pross  as if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers  as if mr  lorry had not known it for a fact  years ago  in the quiet corner in soho  that this precious brother had spent her money and left her   he was saying the affectionate word  however  with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed  which is invariably the case  all the world over   when mr  cruncher  touching him on the shoulder  hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question    i say  might i ask the favour  as to whether your name is john solomon  or solomon john    the official turned towards him with sudden distrust  he had not previously uttered a word    come   said mr  cruncher   speak out  you know    which  by the way  was more than he could do himself    john solomon  or solomon john  she calls you solomon  and she must know  being your sister  and i know you re john  you know  which of the two goes first  and regarding that name of pross  likewise  that warn t your name over the water     what do you mean     well  i don t know all i mean  for i can t call to mind what your name was  over the water     no     no  but i ll swear it was a name of two syllables     indeed     yes  t other one s was one syllable  i know you  you was a spy  witness at the bailey  what  in the name of the father of lies  own father to yourself  was you called at that time     barsad   said another voice  striking in    that s the name for a thousand pound   cried jerry   the speaker who struck in  was sydney carton  he had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding coat  and he stood at mr  cruncher s elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the old bailey itself    don t be alarmed  my dear miss pross  i arrived at mr  lorry s  to his surprise  yesterday evening  we agreed that i would not present myself elsewhere until all was well  or unless i could be useful  i present myself here  to beg a little talk with your brother  i wish you had a better employed brother than mr  barsad  i wish for your sake mr  barsad was not a sheep of the prisons    sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy  under the gaolers  the spy  who was pale  turned paler  and asked him how he dared     i ll tell you   said sydney   i lighted on you  mr  barsad  coming out of the prison of the conciergerie while i was contemplating the walls  an hour or more ago  you have a face to be remembered  and i remember faces well  made curious by seeing you in that connection  and having a reason  to which you are no stranger  for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate  i walked in your direction  i walked into the wine shop here  close after you  and sat near you  i had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation  and the rumour openly going about among your admirers  the nature of your calling  and gradually  what i had done at random  seemed to shape itself into a purpose  mr  barsad     what purpose   the spy asked    it would be troublesome  and might be dangerous  to explain in the street  could you favour me  in confidence  with some minutes of your company  at the office of tellson s bank  for instance     under a threat     oh  did i say that     then  why should i go there     really  mr  barsad  i can t say  if you can t     do you mean that you won t say  sir   the spy irresolutely asked    you apprehend me very clearly  mr  barsad  i won t    carton s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill  in such a business as he had in his secret mind  and with such a man as he had to do with  his practised eye saw it  and made the most of it    now  i told you so   said the spy  casting a reproachful look at his sister   if any trouble comes of this  it s your doing     come  come  mr  barsad   exclaimed sydney   don t be ungrateful  but for my great respect for your sister  i might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make for our mutual satisfaction  do you go with me to the bank     i ll hear what you have got to say  yes  i ll go with you     i propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street  let me take your arm  miss pross  this is not a good city  at this time  for you to be out in  unprotected  and as your escort knows mr  barsad  i will invite him to mr  lorry s with us  are we ready  come then    miss pross recalled soon afterwards  and to the end of her life remembered  that as she pressed her hands on sydney s arm and looked up in his face  imploring him to do no hurt to solomon  there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes  which not only contradicted his light manner  but changed and raised the man  she was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection  and with sydney s friendly reassurances  adequately to heed what she observed   they left her at the corner of the street  and carton led the way to mr  lorry s  which was within a few minutes  walk  john barsad  or solomon pross  walked at his side   mr  lorry had just finished his dinner  and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire  perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from tellson s  who had looked into the red coals at the royal george at dover  now a good many years ago  he turned his head as they entered  and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger    miss pross s brother  sir   said sydney   mr  barsad     barsad   repeated the old gentleman   barsad  i have an association with the name  and with the face     i told you you had a remarkable face  mr  barsad   observed carton  coolly   pray sit down    as he took a chair himself  he supplied the link that mr  lorry wanted  by saying to him with a frown   witness at that trial   mr  lorry immediately remembered  and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence    mr  barsad has been recognised by miss pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of   said sydney   and has acknowledged the relationship  i pass to worse news  darnay has been arrested again    struck with consternation  the old gentleman exclaimed   what do you tell me  i left him safe and free within these two hours  and am about to return to him     arrested for all that  when was it done  mr  barsad     just now  if at all     mr  barsad is the best authority possible  sir   said sydney   and i have it from mr  barsad s communication to a friend and brother sheep over a bottle of wine  that the arrest has taken place  he left the messengers at the gate  and saw them admitted by the porter  there is no earthly doubt that he is retaken    mr  lorry s business eye read in the speaker s face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point  confused  but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind  he commanded himself  and was silently attentive    now  i trust   said sydney to him   that the name and influence of doctor manette may stand him in as good stead to morrow  you said he would be before the tribunal again to morrow  mr  barsad       yes  i believe so       in as good stead to morrow as to day  but it may not be so  i own to you  i am shaken  mr  lorry  by doctor manette s not having had the power to prevent this arrest     he may not have known of it beforehand   said mr  lorry    but that very circumstance would be alarming  when we remember how identified he is with his son in law     that s true   mr  lorry acknowledged  with his troubled hand at his chin  and his troubled eyes on carton    in short   said sydney   this is a desperate time  when desperate games are played for desperate stakes  let the doctor play the winning game  i will play the losing one  no man s life here is worth purchase  any one carried home by the people to day  may be condemned tomorrow  now  the stake i have resolved to play for  in case of the worst  is a friend in the conciergerie  and the friend i purpose to myself to win  is mr  barsad     you need have good cards  sir   said the spy    i ll run them over  i ll see what i hold   mr  lorry  you know what a brute i am  i wish you d give me a little brandy    it was put before him  and he drank off a glassful  drank off another glassful  pushed the bottle thoughtfully away    mr  barsad   he went on  in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards   sheep of the prisons  emissary of republican committees  now turnkey  now prisoner  always spy and secret informer  so much the more valuable here for being english that an englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a frenchman  represents himself to his employers under a false name  that s a very good card  mr  barsad  now in the employ of the republican french government  was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic english government  the enemy of france and freedom  that s an excellent card  inference clear as day in this region of suspicion  that mr  barsad  still in the pay of the aristocratic english government  is the spy of pitt  the treacherous foe of the republic crouching in its bosom  the english traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find  that s a card not to be beaten  have you followed my hand  mr  barsad     not to understand your play   returned the spy  somewhat uneasily    i play my ace  denunciation of mr  barsad to the nearest section committee  look over your hand  mr  barsad  and see what you have  don t hurry    he drew the bottle near  poured out another glassful of brandy  and drank it off  he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him  seeing it  he poured out and drank another glassful    look over your hand carefully  mr  barsad  take time    it was a poorer hand than he suspected  mr  barsad saw losing cards in it that sydney carton knew nothing of  thrown out of his honourable employment in england  through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there  not because he was not wanted there  our english reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date  he knew that he had crossed the channel  and accepted service in france  first  as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there  gradually  as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives  he knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon saint antoine and defarge s wine shop  had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning doctor manette s imprisonment  release  and history  as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the defarges  and tried them on madame defarge  and had broken down with them signally  he always remembered with fear and trembling  that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her  and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved  he had since seen her  in the section of saint antoine  over and over again produce her knitted registers  and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up  he knew  as every one employed as he was did  that he was never safe  that flight was impossible  that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe  and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror  a word might bring it down upon him  once denounced  and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind  he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs  would produce against him that fatal register  and would quash his last chance of life  besides that all secret men are men soon terrified  here were surely cards enough of one black suit  to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over    you scarcely seem to like your hand   said sydney  with the greatest composure   do you play     i think  sir   said the spy  in the meanest manner  as he turned to mr  lorry   i may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence  to put it to this other gentleman  so much your junior  whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that ace of which he has spoken  i admit that i am a spy  and that it is considered a discreditable station  though it must be filled by somebody  but this gentleman is no spy  and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one     i play my ace  mr  barsad   said carton  taking the answer on himself  and looking at his watch   without any scruple  in a very few minutes     i should have hoped  gentlemen both   said the spy  always striving to hook mr  lorry into the discussion   that your respect for my sister      i could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother   said sydney carton    you think not  sir     i have thoroughly made up my mind about it    the smooth manner of the spy  curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress  and probably with his usual demeanour  received such a check from the inscrutability of carton   who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he   that it faltered here and failed him  while he was at a loss  carton said  resuming his former air of contemplating cards    and indeed  now i think again  i have a strong impression that i have another good card here  not yet enumerated  that friend and fellow sheep  who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons  who was he     french  you don t know him   said the spy  quickly    french  eh   repeated carton  musing  and not appearing to notice him at all  though he echoed his word   well  he may be     is  i assure you   said the spy   though it s not important     though it s not important   repeated carton  in the same mechanical way   though it s not important  no  it s not important  no  yet i know the face     i think not  i am sure not  it can t be   said the spy    it can t be   muttered sydney carton  retrospectively  and idling his glass  which fortunately was a small one  again   can t be  spoke good french  yet like a foreigner  i thought     provincial   said the spy    no  foreign   cried carton  striking his open hand on the table  as a light broke clearly on his mind   cly  disguised  but the same man  we had that man before us at the old bailey     now  there you are hasty  sir   said barsad  with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side   there you really give me an advantage over you  cly  who i will unreservedly admit  at this distance of time  was a partner of mine  has been dead several years  i attended him in his last illness  he was buried in london  at the church of saint pancras in the fields  his unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains  but i helped to lay him in his coffin    here  mr  lorry became aware  from where he sat  of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall  tracing it to its source  he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on mr  cruncher s head    let us be reasonable   said the spy   and let us be fair  to show you how mistaken you are  and what an unfounded assumption yours is  i will lay before you a certificate of cly s burial  which i happened to have carried in my pocket book   with a hurried hand he produced and opened it   ever since  there it is  oh  look at it  look at it  you may take it in your hand  it s no forgery    here  mr  lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate  and mr  cruncher rose and stepped forward  his hair could not have been more violently on end  if it had been that moment dressed by the cow with the crumpled horn in the house that jack built   unseen by the spy  mr  cruncher stood at his side  and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff    that there roger cly  master   said mr  cruncher  with a taciturn and iron bound visage   so you put him in his coffin     i did     who took him out of it    barsad leaned back in his chair  and stammered   what do you mean     i mean   said mr  cruncher   that he warn t never in it  no  not he  i ll have my head took off  if he was ever in it    the spy looked round at the two gentlemen  they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at jerry    i tell you   said jerry   that you buried paving stones and earth in that there coffin  don t go and tell me that you buried cly  it was a take in  me and two more knows it     how do you know it     what s that to you  ecod   growled mr  cruncher   it s you i have got a old grudge again  is it  with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen  i d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea    sydney carton  who  with mr  lorry  had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business  here requested mr  cruncher to moderate and explain himself    at another time  sir   he returned  evasively   the present time is ill conwenient for explainin   what i stand to  is  that he knows well wot that there cly was never in that there coffin  let him say he was  in so much as a word of one syllable  and i ll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea   mr  cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer   or i ll out and announce him     humph  i see one thing   said carton   i hold another card  mr  barsad  impossible  here in raging paris  with suspicion filling the air  for you to outlive denunciation  when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself  who  moreover  has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again  a plot in the prisons  of the foreigner against the republic  a strong card  a certain guillotine card  do you play     no   returned the spy   i throw up  i confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob  that i only got away from england at the risk of being ducked to death  and that cly was so ferreted up and down  that he never would have got away at all but for that sham  though how this man knows it was a sham  is a wonder of wonders to me     never you trouble your head about this man   retorted the contentious mr  cruncher   you ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman  and look here  once more    mr  cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberality   i d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea    the sheep of the prisons turned from him to sydney carton  and said  with more decision   it has come to a point  i go on duty soon  and can t overstay my time  you told me you had a proposal  what is it  now  it is of no use asking too much of me  ask me to do anything in my office  putting my head in great extra danger  and i had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent  in short  i should make that choice  you talk of desperation  we are all desperate here  remember  i may denounce you if i think proper  and i can swear my way through stone walls  and so can others  now  what do you want with me     not very much  you are a turnkey at the conciergerie     i tell you once for all  there is no such thing as an escape possible    said the spy  firmly    why need you tell me what i have not asked  you are a turnkey at the conciergerie     i am sometimes     you can be when you choose     i can pass in and out when i choose    sydney carton filled another glass with brandy  poured it slowly out upon the hearth  and watched it as it dropped  it being all spent  he said  rising    so far  we have spoken before these two  because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me  come into the dark room here  and let us have one final word alone       ix  the game made   while sydney carton and the sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room  speaking so low that not a sound was heard  mr  lorry looked at jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust  that honest tradesman s manner of receiving the look  did not inspire confidence  he changed the leg on which he rested  as often as if he had fifty of those limbs  and were trying them all  he examined his finger nails with a very questionable closeness of attention  and whenever mr  lorry s eye caught his  he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it  which is seldom  if ever  known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character    jerry   said mr  lorry   come here    mr  cruncher came forward sideways  with one of his shoulders in advance of him    what have you been  besides a messenger    after some cogitation  accompanied with an intent look at his patron  mr  cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying   agicultooral character     my mind misgives me much   said mr  lorry  angrily shaking a forefinger at him   that you have used the respectable and great house of tellson s as a blind  and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description  if you have  don t expect me to befriend you when you get back to england  if you have  don t expect me to keep your secret  tellson s shall not be imposed upon     i hope  sir   pleaded the abashed mr  cruncher   that a gentleman like yourself wot i ve had the honour of odd jobbing till i m grey at it  would think twice about harming of me  even if it wos so  i don t say it is  but even if it wos  and which it is to be took into account that if it wos  it wouldn t  even then  be all o  one side  there d be two sides to it  there might be medical doctors at the present hour  a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman don t pick up his fardens  fardens  no  nor yet his half fardens  half fardens  no  nor yet his quarter  a banking away like smoke at tellson s  and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly  a going in and going out to their own carriages  ah  equally like smoke  if not more so  well  that  ud be imposing  too  on tellson s  for you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander  and here s mrs  cruncher  or leastways wos in the old england times  and would be to morrow  if cause given  a floppin  again the business to that degree as is ruinating  stark ruinating  whereas them medical doctors  wives don t flop  catch  em at it  or  if they flop  their floppings goes in favour of more patients  and how can you rightly have one without t other  then  wot with undertakers  and wot with parish clerks  and wot with sextons  and wot with private watchmen  all awaricious and all in it   a man wouldn t get much by it  even if it wos so  and wot little a man did get  would never prosper with him  mr  lorry  he d never have no good of it  he d want all along to be out of the line  if he  could see his way out  being once in  even if it wos so     ugh   cried mr  lorry  rather relenting  nevertheless   i am shocked at the sight of you     now  what i would humbly offer to you  sir   pursued mr  cruncher   even if it wos so  which i don t say it is      don t prevaricate   said mr  lorry    no  i will not  sir   returned mr  crunches as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practice   which i don t say it is  wot i would humbly offer to you  sir  would be this  upon that there stool  at that there bar  sets that there boy of mine  brought up and growed up to be a man  wot will errand you  message you  general light job you  till your heels is where your head is  if such should be your wishes  if it wos so  which i still don t say it is  for i will not prewaricate to you  sir   let that there boy keep his father s place  and take care of his mother  don t blow upon that boy s father  do not do it  sir  and let that father go into the line of the reg lar diggin   and make amends for what he would have undug  if it wos so  by diggin  of  em in with a will  and with conwictions respectin  the futur  keepin  of  em safe  that  mr  lorry   said mr  cruncher  wiping his forehead with his arm  as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse   is wot i would respectfully offer to you  sir  a man don t see all this here a goin  on dreadful round him  in the way of subjects without heads  dear me  plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that  without havin  his serious thoughts of things  and these here would be mine  if it wos so  entreatin  of you fur to bear in mind that wot i said just now  i up and said in the good cause when i might have kep  it back     that at least is true   said mr  lorry   say no more now  it may be that i shall yet stand your friend  if you deserve it  and repent in action  not in words  i want no more words    mr  cruncher knuckled his forehead  as sydney carton and the spy returned from the dark room   adieu  mr  barsad   said the former   our arrangement thus made  you have nothing to fear from me    he sat down in a chair on the hearth  over against mr  lorry  when they were alone  mr  lorry asked him what he had done    not much  if it should go ill with the prisoner  i have ensured access to him  once    mr  lorry s countenance fell    it is all i could do   said carton   to propose too much  would be to put this man s head under the axe  and  as he himself said  nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced  it was obviously the weakness of the position  there is no help for it     but access to him   said mr  lorry   if it should go ill before the tribunal  will not save him     i never said it would    mr  lorry s eyes gradually sought the fire  his sympathy with his darling  and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest  gradually weakened them  he was an old man now  overborne with anxiety of late  and his tears fell    you are a good man and a true friend   said carton  in an altered voice   forgive me if i notice that you are affected  i could not see my father weep  and sit by  careless  and i could not respect your sorrow more  if you were my father  you are free from that misfortune  however    though he said the last words  with a slip into his usual manner  there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch  that mr  lorry  who had never seen the better side of him  was wholly unprepared for  he gave him his hand  and carton gently pressed it    to return to poor darnay   said carton   don t tell her of this interview  or this arrangement  it would not enable her to go to see him  she might think it was contrived  in case of the worse  to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence    mr  lorry had not thought of that  and he looked quickly at carton to see if it were in his mind  it seemed to be  he returned the look  and evidently understood it    she might think a thousand things   carton said   and any of them would only add to her trouble  don t speak of me to her  as i said to you when i first came  i had better not see her  i can put my hand out  to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do  without that  you are going to her  i hope  she must be very desolate to night     i am going now  directly     i am glad of that  she has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you  how does she look     anxious and unhappy  but very beautiful     ah    it was a long  grieving sound  like a sigh  almost like a sob  it attracted mr  lorry s eyes to carton s face  which was turned to the fire  a light  or a shade  the old gentleman could not have said which   passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill side on a wild bright day  and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs  which was tumbling forward  he wore the white riding coat and top boots  then in vogue  and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale  with his long brown hair  all untrimmed  hanging loose about him  his indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from mr  lorry  his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log  when it had broken under the weight of his foot    i forgot it   he said   mr  lorry s eyes were again attracted to his face  taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features  and having the expression of prisoners  faces fresh in his mind  he was strongly reminded of that expression    and your duties here have drawn to an end  sir   said carton  turning to him    yes  as i was telling you last night when lucie came in so unexpectedly  i have at length done all that i can do here  i hoped to have left them in perfect safety  and then to have quitted paris  i have my leave to pass  i was ready to go    they were both silent    yours is a long life to look back upon  sir   said carton  wistfully    i am in my seventy eighth year     you have been useful all your life  steadily and constantly occupied  trusted  respected  and looked up to     i have been a man of business  ever since i have been a man  indeed  i may say that i was a man of business when a boy     see what a place you fill at seventy eight  how many people will miss you when you leave it empty     a solitary old bachelor   answered mr  lorry  shaking his head   there is nobody to weep for me     how can you say that  wouldn t she weep for you  wouldn t her child     yes  yes  thank god  i didn t quite mean what i said     it is a thing to thank god for  is it not     surely  surely     if you could say  with truth  to your own solitary heart  to night   i have secured to myself the love and attachment  the gratitude or respect  of no human creature  i have won myself a tender place in no regard  i have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by   your seventy eight years would be seventy eight heavy curses  would they not     you say truly  mr  carton  i think they would be    sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire  and  after a silence of a few moments  said    i should like to ask you   does your childhood seem far off  do the days when you sat at your mother s knee  seem days of very long ago    responding to his softened manner  mr  lorry answered    twenty years back  yes  at this time of my life  no  for  as i draw closer and closer to the end  i travel in the circle  nearer and nearer to the beginning  it seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way  my heart is touched now  by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep  of my pretty young mother  and i so old    and by many associations of the days when what we call the world was not so real with me  and my faults were not confirmed in me     i understand the feeling   exclaimed carton  with a bright flush   and you are the better for it     i hope so    carton terminated the conversation here  by rising to help him on with his outer coat   but you   said mr  lorry  reverting to the theme   you are young     yes   said carton   i am not old  but my young way was never the way to age  enough of me     and of me  i am sure   said mr  lorry   are you going out     i ll walk with you to her gate  you know my vagabond and restless habits  if i should prowl about the streets a long time  don t be uneasy  i shall reappear in the morning  you go to the court to morrow     yes  unhappily     i shall be there  but only as one of the crowd  my spy will find a place for me  take my arm  sir    mr  lorry did so  and they went down stairs and out in the streets  a few minutes brought them to mr  lorry s destination  carton left him there  but lingered at a little distance  and turned back to the gate again when it was shut  and touched it  he had heard of her going to the prison every day   she came out here   he said  looking about him   turned this way  must have trod on these stones often  let me follow in her steps    it was ten o clock at night when he stood before the prison of la force  where she had stood hundreds of times  a little wood sawyer  having closed his shop  was smoking his pipe at his shop door    good night  citizen   said sydney carton  pausing in going by  for  the man eyed him inquisitively    good night  citizen     how goes the republic     you mean the guillotine  not ill  sixty three to day  we shall mount to a hundred soon  samson and his men complain sometimes  of being exhausted  ha  ha  ha  he is so droll  that samson  such a barber     do you often go to see him      shave  always  every day  what a barber  you have seen him at work     never     go and see him when he has a good batch  figure this to yourself  citizen  he shaved the sixty three to day  in less than two pipes  less than two pipes  word of honour    as the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking  to explain how he timed the executioner  carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him  that he turned away    but you are not english   said the wood sawyer   though you wear english dress     yes   said carton  pausing again  and answering over his shoulder    you speak like a frenchman     i am an old student here     aha  a perfect frenchman  good night  englishman     good night  citizen     but go and see that droll dog   the little man persisted  calling after him   and take a pipe with you    sydney had not gone far out of sight  when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp  and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper  then  traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way well  several dark and dirty streets  much dirtier than usual  for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of terror  he stopped at a chemist s shop  which the owner was closing with his own hands  a small  dim  crooked shop  kept in a tortuous  up hill thoroughfare  by a small  dim  crooked man   giving this citizen  too  good night  as he confronted him at his counter  he laid the scrap of paper before him   whew   the chemist whistled softly  as he read it   hi  hi  hi    sydney carton took no heed  and the chemist said    for you  citizen     for me     you will be careful to keep them separate  citizen  you know the consequences of mixing them     perfectly    certain small packets were made and given to him  he put them  one by one  in the breast of his inner coat  counted out the money for them  and deliberately left the shop   there is nothing more to do   said he  glancing upward at the moon   until to morrow  i can t sleep    it was not a reckless manner  the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fast sailing clouds  nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance  it was the settled manner of a tired man  who had wandered and struggled and got lost  but who at length struck into his road and saw its end   long ago  when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a youth of great promise  he had followed his father to the grave  his mother had died  years before  these solemn words  which had been read at his father s grave  arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets  among the heavy shadows  with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him   i am the resurrection and the life  saith the lord  he that believeth in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live  and whosoever liveth and believeth in me  shall never die    in a city dominated by the axe  alone at night  with natural sorrow rising in him for the sixty three who had been that day put to death  and for to morrow s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons  and still of to morrow s and to morrow s  the chain of association that brought the words home  like a rusty old ship s anchor from the deep  might have been easily found  he did not seek it  but repeated them and went on   with a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest  forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them  in the towers of the churches  where no prayers were said  for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of self destruction from years of priestly impostors  plunderers  and profligates  in the distant burial places  reserved  as they wrote upon the gates  for eternal sleep  in the abounding gaols  and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material  that no sorrowful story of a haunting spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the guillotine  with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury  sydney carton crossed the seine again for the lighter streets   few coaches were abroad  for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected  and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps  and put on heavy shoes  and trudged  but  the theatres were all well filled  and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed  and went chatting home  at one of the theatre doors  there was a little girl with a mother  looking for a way across the street through the mud  he carried the child over  and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss    i am the resurrection and the life  saith the lord  he that believeth in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live  and whosoever liveth and believeth in me  shall never die    now  that the streets were quiet  and the night wore on  the words were in the echoes of his feet  and were in the air  perfectly calm and steady  he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked  but  he heard them always   the night wore out  and  as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river walls of the island of paris  where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon  the day came coldly  looking like a dead face out of the sky  then  the night  with the moon and the stars  turned pale and died  and for a little while it seemed as if creation were delivered over to death s dominion   but  the glorious sun  rising  seemed to strike those words  that burden of the night  straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays  and looking along them  with reverently shaded eyes  a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him and the sun  while the river sparkled under it   the strong tide  so swift  so deep  and certain  was like a congenial friend  in the morning stillness  he walked by the stream  far from the houses  and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank  when he awoke and was afoot again  he lingered there yet a little longer  watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless  until the stream absorbed it  and carried it on to the sea    like me    a trading boat  with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf  then glided into his view  floated by him  and died away  as its silent track in the water disappeared  the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors  ended in the words   i am the resurrection and the life    mr  lorry was already out when he got back  and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone  sydney carton drank nothing but a little coffee  ate some bread  and  having washed and changed to refresh himself  went out to the place of trial   the court was all astir and a buzz  when the black sheep  whom many fell away from in dread  pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd  mr  lorry was there  and doctor manette was there  she was there  sitting beside her father   when her husband was brought in  she turned a look upon him  so sustaining  so encouraging  so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness  yet so courageous for his sake  that it called the healthy blood into his face  brightened his glance  and animated his heart  if there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look  on sydney carton  it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly   before that unjust tribunal  there was little or no order of procedure  ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing  there could have been no such revolution  if all laws  forms  and ceremonies  had not first been so monstrously abused  that the suicidal vengeance of the revolution was to scatter them all to the winds   every eye was turned to the jury  the same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before  and to morrow and the day after  eager and prominent among them  one man with a craving face  and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips  whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators  a life thirsting  cannibal looking  bloody minded juryman  the jacques three of st  antoine  the whole jury  as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer   every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor  no favourable leaning in that quarter to day  a fell  uncompromising  murderous business meaning there  every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd  and gleamed at it approvingly  and heads nodded at one another  before bending forward with a strained attention   charles evrémonde  called darnay  released

that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people  charles evrémonde  called darnay  in right of such proscription  absolutely dead in law   to this effect  in as

standing where he had been seated    president  i indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud  you know the accused to be the husband of my daughter  my daughter  and those dear to her  are far dearer to me than my life  who and where is the false conspirator who says that i denounce the husband of my child     citizen manette  be tranquil  to fail in submission to the authority of the tribunal would be to put yourself out of law  as to what is dearer to you than life  nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the republic    loud acclamations hailed this rebuke  the president rang his bell  and with warmth resumed    if the republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself  you would have no duty but to sacrifice her  listen to what is to follow  in the meanwhile  be silent    frantic acclamations were again raised  doctor manette sat down  with his eyes looking around  and his lips trembling  his daughter drew closer to him  the craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together  and restored the usual hand to his mouth   defarge was produced  when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard  and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment  and of his having been a mere boy in the doctor s service  and of the release  and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him  this short examination followed  for the court was quick with its work    you did good service at the taking of the bastille  citizen     i believe so    here  an excited woman screeched from the crowd   you were one of the best patriots there  why not say so  you were a cannonier that day there  and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell  patriots  i speak the truth    it was the vengeance who  amidst the warm commendations of the audience  thus assisted the proceedings  the president rang his bell  but  the vengeance  warming with encouragement  shrieked   i defy that bell    wherein she was likewise much commended    inform the tribunal of what you did that day within the bastille  citizen     i knew   said defarge  looking down at his wife  who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised  looking steadily up at him   i knew that this prisoner  of whom i speak  had been confined in a cell known as one hundred and five  north tower  i knew it from himself  he knew himself by no other name than one hundred and five  north tower  when he made shoes under my care  as i serve my gun that day  i resolve  when the place shall fall  to examine that cell  it falls  i mount to the cell  with a fellow citizen who is one of the jury  directed by a gaoler  i examine it  very closely  in a hole in the chimney  where a stone has been worked out and replaced  i find a written paper  this is that written paper  i have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of doctor manette  this is the writing of doctor manette  i confide this paper  in the writing of doctor manette  to the hands of the president     let it be read    in a dead silence and stillness  the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife  his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father  doctor manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader  madame defarge never taking hers from the prisoner  defarge never taking his from his feasting wife  and all the other eyes there intent upon the doctor  who saw none of them  the paper was read  as follows      x  the substance of the shadow    i  alexandre manette  unfortunate physician  native of beauvais  and afterwards resident in paris  write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the bastille  during the last month of the year    i write it at stolen intervals  under every difficulty  i design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney  where i have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it  some pitying hand may find it there  when i and my sorrows are dust    these words are formed by the rusty iron point with which i write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney  mixed with blood  in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity  hope has quite departed from my breast  i know from terrible warnings i have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired  but i solemnly declare that i am at this time in the possession of my right mind  that my memory is exact and circumstantial  and that i write the truth as i shall answer for these my last recorded words  whether they be ever read by men or not  at the eternal judgment seat    one cloudy moonlight night  in the third week of december  i think the twenty second of the month  in the year   i was walking on a retired part of the quay by the seine for the refreshment of the frosty air  at an hour s distance from my place of residence in the street of the school of medicine  when a carriage came along behind me  driven very fast  as i stood aside to let that carriage pass  apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down  a head was put out at the window  and a voice called to the driver to stop    the carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses  and the same voice called to me by my name  i answered  the carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before i came up with it    i observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks  and appeared to conceal themselves  as they stood side by side near the carriage door  i also observed that they both looked of about my own age  or rather younger  and that they were greatly alike  in stature  manner  voice  and  as far as i could see  face too     you are doctor manette   said one    i am      doctor manette  formerly of beauvais   said the other   the young physician  originally an expert surgeon  who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in paris      gentlemen   i returned   i am that doctor manette of whom you speak so graciously      we have been to your residence   said the first   and not being so fortunate as to find you there  and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction  we followed  in the hope of overtaking you  will you please to enter the carriage     the manner of both was imperious  and they both moved  as these words were spoken  so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door  they were armed  i was not     gentlemen   said i   pardon me  but i usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance  and what is the nature of the case to which i am summoned     the reply to this was made by him who had spoken second   doctor  your clients are people of condition  as to the nature of the case  our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it  enough  will you please to enter the carriage     i could do nothing but comply  and i entered it in silence  they both entered after me  the last springing in  after putting up the steps  the carriage turned about  and drove on at its former speed    i repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred  i have no doubt that it is  word for word  the same  i describe everything exactly as it took place  constraining my mind not to wander from the task  where i make the broken marks that follow here  i leave off for the time  and put my paper in its hiding place                   the carriage left the streets behind  passed the north barrier  and emerged upon the country road  at two thirds of a league from the barrier  i did not estimate the distance at that time  but afterwards when i traversed it  it struck out of the main avenue  and presently stopped at a solitary house  we all three alighted  and walked  by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed  to the door of the house  it was not opened immediately  in answer to the ringing of the bell  and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it  with his heavy riding glove  across the face    there was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention  for i had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs  but  the other of the two  being angry likewise  struck the man in like manner with his arm  the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike  that i then first perceived them to be twin brothers    from the time of our alighting at the outer gate  which we found locked  and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us  and had relocked   i had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber  i was conducted to this chamber straight  the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs  and i found a patient in a high fever of the brain  lying on a bed    the patient was a woman of great beauty  and young  assuredly not much past twenty  her hair was torn and ragged  and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs  i noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentleman s dress  on one of them  which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony  i saw the armorial bearings of a noble  and the letter e    i saw this  within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient  for  in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed  had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth  and was in danger of suffocation  my first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing  and in moving the scarf aside  the embroidery in the corner caught my sight    i turned her gently over  placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down  and looked into her face  her eyes were dilated and wild  and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks  and repeated the words   my husband  my father  and my brother   and then counted up to twelve  and said   hush   for an instant  and no more  she would pause to listen  and then the piercing shrieks would begin again  and she would repeat the cry   my husband  my father  and my brother   and would count up to twelve  and say   hush   there was no variation in the order  or the manner  there was no cessation  but the regular moment s pause  in the utterance of these sounds     how long   i asked   has this lasted     to distinguish the brothers  i will call them the elder and the younger  by the elder  i mean him who exercised the most authority  it was the elder who replied   since about this hour last night      she has a husband  a father  and a brother      a brother      i do not address her brother     he answered with great contempt   no      she has some recent association with the number twelve     the younger brother impatiently rejoined   with twelve o clock      see  gentlemen   said i  still keeping my hands upon her breast   how useless i am  as you have brought me  if i had known what i was coming to see  i could have come provided  as it is  time must be lost  there are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place     the elder brother looked to the younger  who said haughtily   there is a case of medicines here   and brought it from a closet  and put it on the table                   i opened some of the bottles  smelt them  and put the stoppers to my lips  if i had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves  i would not have administered any of those     do you doubt them   asked the younger brother     you see  monsieur  i am going to use them   i replied  and said no more    i made the patient swallow  with great difficulty  and after many efforts  the dose that i desired to give  as i intended to repeat it after a while  and as it was necessary to watch its influence  i then sat down by the side of the bed  there was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance  wife of the man down stairs   who had retreated into a corner  the house was damp and decayed  indifferently furnished  evidently  recently occupied and temporarily used  some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows  to deaden the sound of the shrieks  they continued to be uttered in their regular succession  with the cry   my husband  my father  and my brother   the counting up to twelve  and  hush   the frenzy was so violent  that i had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms  but  i had looked to them  to see that they were not painful  the only spark of encouragement in the case  was  that my hand upon the sufferer s breast had this much soothing influence  that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure  it had no effect upon the cries  no pendulum could be more regular    for the reason that my hand had this effect  i assume   i had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour  with the two brothers looking on  before the elder said     there is another patient     i was startled  and asked   is it a pressing case      you had better see   he carelessly answered  and took up a light                   the other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase  which was a species of loft over a stable  there was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it  the rest was open  to the ridge of the tiled roof  and there were beams across  hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place  fagots for firing  and a heap of apples in sand  i had to pass through that part  to get at the other  my memory is circumstantial and unshaken  i try it with these details  and i see them all  in this my cell in the bastille  near the close of the tenth year of my captivity  as i saw them all that night    on some hay on the ground  with a cushion thrown under his head  lay a handsome peasant boy  a boy of not more than seventeen at the most  he lay on his back  with his teeth set  his right hand clenched on his breast  and his glaring eyes looking straight upward  i could not see where his wound was  as i kneeled on one knee over him  but  i could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point     i am a doctor  my poor fellow   said i   let me examine it      i do not want it examined   he answered   let it be     it was under his hand  and i soothed him to let me move his hand away  the wound was a sword thrust  received from twenty to twenty four hours before  but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay  he was then dying fast  as i turned my eyes to the elder brother  i saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out  as if he were a wounded bird  or hare  or rabbit  not at all as if he were a fellow creature     how has this been done  monsieur   said i     a crazed young common dog  a serf  forced my brother to draw upon him  and has fallen by my brother s sword  like a gentleman     there was no touch of pity  sorrow  or kindred humanity  in this answer  the speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there  and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind  he was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy  or about his fate    the boy s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken  and they now slowly moved to me     doctor  they are very proud  these nobles  but we common dogs are proud too  sometimes  they plunder us  outrage us  beat us  kill us  but we have a little pride left  sometimes  she  have you seen her  doctor     the shrieks and the cries were audible there  though subdued by the distance  he referred to them  as if she were lying in our presence    i said   i have seen her      she is my sister  doctor  they have had their shameful rights  these nobles  in the modesty and virtue of our sisters  many years  but we have had good girls among us  i know it  and have heard my father say so  she was a good girl  she was betrothed to a good young man  too  a tenant of his  we were all tenants of his  that man s who stands there  the other is his brother  the worst of a bad race     it was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak  but  his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis     we were so robbed by that man who stands there  as all we common dogs are by those superior beings  taxed by him without mercy  obliged to work for him without pay  obliged to grind our corn at his mill  obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops  and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own  pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat  we ate it in fear  with the door barred and the shutters closed  that his people should not see it and take it from us  i say  we were so robbed  and hunted  and were made so poor  that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world  and that what we should most pray for  was  that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out     i had never before seen the sense of being oppressed  bursting forth like a fire  i had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere  but  i had never seen it break out  until i saw it in the dying boy     nevertheless  doctor  my sister married  he was ailing at that time  poor fellow  and she married her lover  that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage  our dog hut  as that man would call it  she had not been married many weeks  when that man s brother saw her and admired her  and asked that man to lend her to him  for what are husbands among us  he was willing enough  but my sister was good and virtuous  and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine  what did the two then  to persuade her husband to use his influence with her  to make her willing     the boy s eyes  which had been fixed on mine  slowly turned to the looker on  and i saw in the two faces that all he said was true  the two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another  i can see  even in this bastille  the gentleman s  all negligent indifference  the peasant s  all trodden down sentiment  and passionate revenge     you know  doctor  that it is among the rights of these nobles to harness us common dogs to carts  and drive us  they so harnessed him and drove him  you know that it is among their rights to keep us in their grounds all night  quieting the frogs  in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed  they kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night  and ordered him back into his harness in the day  but he was not persuaded  no  taken out of harness one day at noon  to feed  if he could find food  he sobbed twelve times  once for every stroke of the bell  and died on her bosom     nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong  he forced back the gathering shadows of death  as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched  and to cover his wound     then  with that man s permission and even with his aid  his brother took her away  in spite of what i know she must have told his brother  and what that is  will not be long unknown to you  doctor  if it is now  his brother took her away  for his pleasure and diversion  for a little while  i saw her pass me on the road  when i took the tidings home  our father s heart burst  he never spoke one of the words that filled it  i took my young sister  for i have another  to a place beyond the reach of this man  and where  at least  she will never be his vassal  then  i tracked the brother here  and last night climbed in  a common dog  but sword in hand   where is the loft window  it was somewhere here     the room was darkening to his sight  the world was narrowing around him  i glanced about me  and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor  as if there had been a struggle     she heard me  and ran in  i told her not to come near us till he was dead  he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money  then struck at me with a whip  but i  though a common dog  so struck at him as to make him draw  let him break into as many pieces as he will  the sword that he stained with my common blood  he drew to defend himself  thrust at me with all his skill for his life     my glance had fallen  but a few moments before  on the fragments of a broken sword  lying among the hay  that weapon was a gentleman s  in another place  lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier s     now  lift me up  doctor  lift me up  where is he      he is not here   i said  supporting the boy  and thinking that he referred to the brother     he  proud as these nobles are  he is afraid to see me  where is the man who was here  turn my face to him     i did so  raising the boy s head against my knee  but  invested for the moment with extraordinary power  he raised himself completely  obliging me to rise too  or i could not have still supported him     marquis   said the boy  turned to him with his eyes opened wide  and his right hand raised   in the days when all these things are to be answered for  i summon you and yours  to the last of your bad race  to answer for them  i mark this cross of blood upon you  as a sign that i do it  in the days when all these things are to be answered for  i summon your brother  the worst of the bad race  to answer for them separately  i mark this cross of blood upon him  as a sign that i do it     twice  he put his hand to the wound in his breast  and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air  he stood for an instant with the finger yet raised  and as it dropped  he dropped with it  and i laid him down dead                   when i returned to the bedside of the young woman  i found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity  i knew that this might last for many hours  and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave    i repeated the medicines i had given her  and i sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced  she never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks  never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words  they were always  my husband  my father  and my brother  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten  eleven  twelve  hush     this lasted twenty six hours from the time when i first saw her  i had come and gone twice  and was again sitting by her  when she began to falter  i did what little could be done to assist that opportunity  and by and bye she sank into a lethargy  and lay like the dead    it was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last  after a long and fearful storm  i released her arms  and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn  it was then that i knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen  and it was then that i lost the little hope i had had of her     is she dead   asked the marquis  whom i will still describe as the elder brother  coming booted into the room from his horse     not dead   said i   but like to die      what strength there is in these common bodies   he said  looking down at her with some curiosity     there is prodigious strength   i answered him   in sorrow and despair     he first laughed at my words  and then frowned at them  he moved a chair with his foot near to mine  ordered the woman away  and said in a subdued voice     doctor  finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds  i recommended that your aid should be invited  your reputation is high  and  as a young man with your fortune to make  you are probably mindful of your interest  the things that you see here  are things to be seen  and not spoken of     i listened to the patient s breathing  and avoided answering     do you honour me with your attention  doctor      monsieur   said i   in my profession  the communications of patients are always received in confidence   i was guarded in my answer  for i was troubled in my mind with what i had heard and seen    her breathing was so difficult to trace  that i carefully tried the pulse and the heart  there was life  and no more  looking round as i resumed my seat  i found both the brothers intent upon me                   i write with so much difficulty  the cold is so severe  i am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness  that i must abridge this narrative  there is no confusion or failure in my memory  it can recall  and could detail  every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers    she lingered for a week  towards the last  i could understand some few syllables that she said to me  by placing my ear close to her lips  she asked me where she was  and i told her  who i was  and i told her  it was in vain that i asked her for her family name  she faintly shook her head upon the pillow  and kept her secret  as the boy had done    i had no opportunity of asking her any question  until i had told the brothers she was sinking fast  and could not live another day  until then  though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself  one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when i was there  but when it came to that  they seemed careless what communication i might hold with her  as if  the thought passed through my mind  i were dying too    i always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother s  as i call him  having crossed swords with a peasant  and that peasant a boy  the only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family  and was ridiculous  as often as i caught the younger brother s eyes  their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply  for knowing what i knew from the boy  he was smoother and more polite to me than the elder  but i saw this  i also saw that i was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder  too    my patient died  two hours before midnight  at a time  by my watch  answering almost to the minute when i had first seen her  i was alone with her  when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side  and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended    the brothers were waiting in a room down stairs  impatient to ride away  i had heard them  alone at the bedside  striking their boots with their riding whips  and loitering up and down     at last she is dead   said the elder  when i went in     she is dead   said i     i congratulate you  my brother   were his words as he turned round    he had before offered me money  which i had postponed taking  he now gave me a rouleau of gold  i took it from his hand  but laid it on the table  i had considered the question  and had resolved to accept nothing     pray excuse me   said i   under the circumstances  no     they exchanged looks  but bent their heads to me as i bent mine to them  and we parted without another word on either side                   i am weary  weary  weary  worn down by misery  i cannot read what i have written with this gaunt hand    early in the morning  the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box  with my name on the outside  from the first  i had anxiously considered what i ought to do  i decided  that day  to write privately to the minister  stating the nature of the two cases to which i had been summoned  and the place to which i had gone  in effect  stating all the circumstances  i knew what court influence was  and what the immunities of the nobles were  and i expected that the matter would never be heard of  but  i wished to relieve my own mind  i had kept the matter a profound secret  even from my wife  and this  too  i resolved to state in my letter  i had no apprehension whatever of my real danger  but i was conscious that there might be danger for others  if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that i possessed    i was much engaged that day  and could not complete my letter that night  i rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it  it was the last day of the year  the letter was lying before me just completed  when i was told that a lady waited  who wished to see me                   i am growing more and more unequal to the task i have set myself  it is so cold  so dark  my senses are so benumbed  and the gloom upon me is so dreadful    the lady was young  engaging  and handsome  but not marked for long life  she was in great agitation  she presented herself to me as the wife of the marquis st  evrémonde  i connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother  with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf  and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that i had seen that nobleman very lately    my memory is still accurate  but i cannot write the words of our conversation  i suspect that i am watched more closely than i was  and i know not at what times i may be watched  she had in part suspected  and in part discovered  the main facts of the cruel story  of her husband s share in it  and my being resorted to  she did not know that the girl was dead  her hope had been  she said in great distress  to show her  in secret  a woman s sympathy  her hope had been to avert the wrath of heaven from a house that had long been hateful to the suffering many    she had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living  and her greatest desire was  to help that sister  i could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister  beyond that  i knew nothing  her inducement to come to me  relying on my confidence  had been the hope that i could tell her the name and place of abode  whereas  to this wretched hour i am ignorant of both                   these scraps of paper fail me  one was taken from me  with a warning  yesterday  i must finish my record to day    she was a good  compassionate lady  and not happy in her marriage  how could she be  the brother distrusted and disliked her  and his influence was all opposed to her  she stood in dread of him  and in dread of her husband too  when i handed her down to the door  there was a child  a pretty boy from two to three years old  in her carriage     for his sake  doctor   she said  pointing to him in tears   i would do all i can to make what poor amends i can  he will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise  i have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this  it will one day be required of him  what i have left to call my own  it is little beyond the worth of a few jewels  i will make it the first charge of his life to bestow  with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother  on this injured family  if the sister can be discovered     she kissed the boy  and said  caressing him   it is for thine own dear sake  thou wilt be faithful  little charles   the child answered her bravely   yes   i kissed her hand  and she took him in her arms  and went away caressing him  i never saw her more    as she had mentioned her husband s name in the faith that i knew it  i added no mention of it to my letter  i sealed my letter  and  not trusting it out of my own hands  delivered it myself that day    that night  the last night of the year  towards nine o clock  a man in a black dress rang at my gate  demanded to see me  and softly followed my servant  ernest defarge  a youth  up stairs  when my servant came into the room where i sat with my wife  o my wife  beloved of my heart  my fair young english wife   we saw the man  who was supposed to be at the gate  standing silent behind him    an urgent case in the rue st  honore  he said  it would not detain me  he had a coach in waiting    it brought me here  it brought me to my grave  when i was clear of the house  a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind  and my arms were pinioned  the two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner  and identified me with a single gesture  the marquis took from his pocket the letter i had written  showed it me  burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held  and extinguished the ashes with his foot  not a word was spoken  i was brought here  i was brought to my living grave    if it had pleased god to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers  in all these frightful years  to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife  so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead  i might have thought that he had not quite abandoned them  but  now i believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them  and that they have no part in his mercies  and them and their descendants  to the last of their race  i  alexandre manette  unhappy prisoner  do this last night of the year   in my unbearable agony  denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for  i denounce them to heaven and to earth    a terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done  a sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood  the narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time  and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it   little need  in presence of that tribunal and that auditory  to show how the defarges had not made the paper public  with the other captured bastille memorials borne in procession  and had kept it  biding their time  little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by saint antoine  and was wrought into the fatal register  the man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day  against such denunciation   and all the worse for the doomed man  that the denouncer was a well known citizen  his own attached friend  the father of his wife  one of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was  for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity  and for sacrifices and self immolations on the people s altar  therefore when the president said  else had his own head quivered on his shoulders   that the good physician of the republic would deserve better still of the republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of aristocrats  and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan  there was wild excitement  patriotic fervour  not a touch of human sympathy    much influence around him  has that doctor   murmured madame defarge  smiling to the vengeance   save him now  my doctor  save him    at every juryman s vote  there was a roar  another and another  roar and roar   unanimously voted  at heart and by descent an aristocrat  an enemy of the republic  a notorious oppressor of the people  back to the conciergerie  and death within four and twenty hours      xi  dusk   the wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die  fell under the sentence  as if she had been mortally stricken  but  she uttered no sound  and so strong was the voice within her  representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it  that it quickly raised her  even from that shock   the judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors  the tribunal adjourned  the quick noise and movement of the court s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased  when lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband  with nothing in her face but love and consolation    if i might touch him  if i might embrace him once  o  good citizens  if you would have so much compassion for us    there was but a gaoler left  along with two of the four men who had taken him last night  and barsad  the people had all poured out to the show in the streets  barsad proposed to the rest   let her embrace him then  it is but a moment   it was silently acquiesced in  and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place  where he  by leaning over the dock  could fold her in his arms    farewell  dear darling of my soul  my parting blessing on my love  we shall meet again  where the weary are at rest    they were her husband s words  as he held her to his bosom    i can bear it  dear charles  i am supported from above  don t suffer for me  a parting blessing for our child     i send it to her by you  i kiss her by you  i say farewell to her by you     my husband  no  a moment   he was tearing himself apart from her   we shall not be separated long  i feel that this will break my heart by and bye  but i will do my duty while i can  and when i leave her  god will raise up friends for her  as he did for me    her father had followed her  and would have fallen on his knees to both of them  but that darnay put out a hand and seized him  crying    no  no  what have you done  what have you done  that you should kneel to us  we know now  what a struggle you made of old  we know  now what you underwent when you suspected my descent  and when you knew it  we know now  the natural antipathy you strove against  and conquered  for her dear sake  we thank you with all our hearts  and all our love and duty  heaven be with you    her father s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair  and wring them with a shriek of anguish    it could not be otherwise   said the prisoner   all things have worked together as they have fallen out  it was the always vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother s trust that first brought my fatal presence near you  good could never come of such evil  a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning  be comforted  and forgive me  heaven bless you    as he was drawn away  his wife released him  and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer  and with a radiant look upon her face  in which there was even a comforting smile  as he went out at the prisoners  door  she turned  laid her head lovingly on her father s breast  tried to speak to him  and fell at his feet   then  issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved  sydney carton came and took her up  only her father and mr  lorry were with her  his arm trembled as it raised her  and supported her head  yet  there was an air about him that was not all of pity  that had a flush of pride in it    shall i take her to a coach  i shall never feel her weight    he carried her lightly to the door  and laid her tenderly down in a coach  her father and their old friend got into it  and he took his seat beside the driver   when they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before  to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden  he lifted her again  and carried her up the staircase to their rooms  there  he laid her down on a couch  where her child and miss pross wept over her    don t recall her to herself   he said  softly  to the latter   she is better so  don t revive her to consciousness  while she only faints     oh  carton  carton  dear carton   cried little lucie  springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him  in a burst of grief   now that you have come  i think you will do something to help mamma  something to save papa  o  look at her  dear carton  can you  of all the people who love her  bear to see her so    he bent over the child  and laid her blooming cheek against his face  he put her gently from him  and looked at her unconscious mother    before i go   he said  and paused   i may kiss her    it was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips  he murmured some words  the child  who was nearest to him  told them afterwards  and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady  that she heard him say   a life you love    when he had gone out into the next room  he turned suddenly on mr  lorry and her father  who were following  and said to the latter    you had great influence but yesterday  doctor manette  let it at least be tried  these judges  and all the men in power  are very friendly to you  and very recognisant of your services  are they not     nothing connected with charles was concealed from me  i had the strongest assurances that i should save him  and i did   he returned the answer in great trouble  and very slowly    try them again  the hours between this and to morrow afternoon are few and short  but try     i intend to try  i will not rest a moment     that s well  i have known such energy as yours do great things before now  though never   he added  with a smile and a sigh together   such great things as this  but try  of little worth as life is when we misuse it  it is worth that effort  it would cost nothing to lay down if it were not     i will go   said doctor manette   to the prosecutor and the president straight  and i will go to others whom it is better not to name  i will write too  and  but stay  there is a celebration in the streets  and no one will be accessible until dark     that s true  well  it is a forlorn hope at the best  and not much the forlorner for being delayed till dark  i should like to know how you speed  though  mind  i expect nothing  when are you likely to have seen these dread powers  doctor manette     immediately after dark  i should hope  within an hour or two from this     it will be dark soon after four  let us stretch the hour or two  if i go to mr  lorry s at nine  shall i hear what you have done  either from our friend or from yourself     yes     may you prosper    mr  lorry followed sydney to the outer door  and  touching him on the shoulder as he was going away  caused him to turn    i have no hope   said mr  lorry  in a low and sorrowful whisper    nor have i     if any one of these men  or all of these men  were disposed to spare him  which is a large supposition  for what is his life  or any man s to them   i doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court     and so do i  i heard the fall of the axe in that sound    mr  lorry leaned his arm upon the door post  and bowed his face upon it    don t despond   said carton  very gently   don t grieve  i encouraged doctor manette in this idea  because i felt that it might one day be consolatory to her  otherwise  she might think  his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted   and that might trouble her     yes  yes  yes   returned mr  lorry  drying his eyes   you are right  but he will perish  there is no real hope     yes  he will perish  there is no real hope   echoed carton   and walked with a settled step  down stairs      xii  darkness   sydney carton paused in the street  not quite decided where to go   at tellson s banking house at nine   he said  with a musing face   shall i do well  in the mean time  to show myself  i think so  it is best that these people should know there is such a man as i here  it is a sound precaution  and may be a necessary preparation  but care  care  care  let me think it out    checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object  he took a turn or two in the already darkening street  and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences  his first impression was confirmed   it is best   he said  finally resolved   that these people should know there is such a man as i here   and he turned his face towards saint antoine   defarge had described himself  that day  as the keeper of a wine shop in the saint antoine suburb  it was not difficult for one who knew the city well  to find his house without asking any question  having ascertained its situation  carton came out of those closer streets again  and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner  for the first time in many years  he had no strong drink  since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine  and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on mr  lorry s hearth like a man who had done with it   it was as late as seven o clock when he awoke refreshed  and went out into the streets again  as he passed along towards saint antoine  he stopped at a shop window where there was a mirror  and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat  and his coat collar  and his wild hair  this done  he went on direct to defarge s  and went in   there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three  of the restless fingers and the croaking voice  this man  whom he had seen upon the jury  stood drinking at the little counter  in conversation with the defarges  man and wife  the vengeance assisted in the conversation  like a regular member of the establishment   as carton walked in  took his seat and asked  in very indifferent french  for a small measure of wine  madame defarge cast a careless glance at him  and then a keener  and then a keener  and then advanced to him herself  and asked him what it was he had ordered   he repeated what he had already said    english   asked madame defarge  inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows   after looking at her  as if the sound of even a single french word were slow to express itself to him  he answered  in his former strong foreign accent   yes  madame  yes  i am english    madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine  and  as he took up a jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning  he heard her say   i swear to you  like evrémonde    defarge brought him the wine  and gave him good evening    how     good evening     oh  good evening  citizen   filling his glass   ah  and good wine  i drink to the republic    defarge went back to the counter  and said   certainly  a little like    madame sternly retorted   i tell you a good deal like   jacques three pacifically remarked   he is so much in your mind  see you  madame    the amiable vengeance added  with a laugh   yes  my faith  and you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more to morrow    carton followed the lines and words of his paper  with a slow forefinger  and with a studious and absorbed face  they were all leaning their arms on the counter close together  speaking low  after a silence of a few moments  during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the jacobin editor  they resumed their conversation    it is true what madame says   observed jacques three   why stop  there is great force in that  why stop     well  well   reasoned defarge   but one must stop somewhere  after all  the question is still where     at extermination   said madame    magnificent   croaked jacques three  the vengeance  also  highly approved    extermination is good doctrine  my wife   said defarge  rather troubled   in general  i say nothing against it  but this doctor has suffered much  you have seen him to day  you have observed his face when the paper was read     i have observed his face   repeated madame  contemptuously and angrily   yes  i have observed his face  i have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the republic  let him take care of his face     and you have observed  my wife   said defarge  in a deprecatory manner   the anguish of his daughter  which must be a dreadful anguish to him     i have observed his daughter   repeated madame   yes  i have observed his daughter  more times than one  i have observed her to day  and i have observed her other days  i have observed her in the court  and i have observed her in the street by the prison  let me but lift my finger     she seemed to raise it  the listener s eyes were always on his paper   and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her  as if the axe had dropped    the citizeness is superb   croaked the juryman    she is an angel   said the vengeance  and embraced her    as to thee   pursued madame  implacably  addressing her husband   if it depended on thee  which  happily  it does not  thou wouldst rescue this man even now     no   protested defarge   not if to lift this glass would do it  but i would leave the matter there  i say  stop there     see you then  jacques   said madame defarge  wrathfully   and see you  too  my little vengeance  see you both  listen  for other crimes as tyrants and oppressors  i have this race a long time on my register  doomed to destruction and extermination  ask my husband  is that so     it is so   assented defarge  without being asked    in the beginning of the great days  when the bastille falls  he finds this paper of to day  and he brings it home  and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut  we read it  here on this spot  by the light of this lamp  ask him  is that so     it is so   assented defarge    that night  i tell him  when the paper is read through  and the lamp is burnt out  and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars  that i have now a secret to communicate  ask him  is that so     it is so   assented defarge again    i communicate to him that secret  i smite this bosom with these two hands as i smite it now  and i tell him   defarge  i was brought up among the fishermen of the sea shore  and that peasant family so injured by the two evrémonde brothers  as that bastille paper describes  is my family  defarge  that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister  that husband was my sister s husband  that unborn child was their child  that brother was my brother  that father was my father  those dead are my dead  and that summons to answer for those things descends to me   ask him  is that so     it is so   assented defarge once more    then tell wind and fire where to stop   returned madame   but don t tell me    both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath  the listener could feel how white she was  without seeing her  and both highly commended it  defarge  a weak minority  interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis  but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply   tell the wind and the fire where to stop  not me    customers entered  and the group was broken up  the english customer paid for what he had had  perplexedly counted his change  and asked  as a stranger  to be directed towards the national palace  madame defarge took him to the door  and put her arm on his  in pointing out the road  the english customer was not without his reflections then  that it might be a good deed to seize that arm  lift it  and strike under it sharp and deep   but  he went his way  and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall  at the appointed hour  he emerged from it to present himself in mr  lorry s room again  where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety  he said he had been with lucie until just now  and had only left her for a few minutes  to come and keep his appointment  her father had not been seen  since he quitted the banking house towards four o clock  she had some faint hopes that his mediation might save charles  but they were very slight  he had been more than five hours gone  where could he be   mr  lorry waited until ten  but  doctor manette not returning  and he being unwilling to leave lucie any longer  it was arranged that he should go back to her  and come to the banking house again at midnight  in the meanwhile  carton would wait alone by the fire for the doctor   he waited and waited  and the clock struck twelve  but doctor manette did not come back  mr  lorry returned  and found no tidings of him  and brought none  where could he be   they were discussing this question  and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence  when they heard him on the stairs  the instant he entered the room  it was plain that all was lost   whether he had really been to any one  or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets  was never known  as he stood staring at them  they asked him no question  for his face told them everything    i cannot find it   said he   and i must have it  where is it    his head and throat were bare  and  as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around  he took his coat off  and let it drop on the floor    where is my bench  i have been looking everywhere for my bench  and i can t find it  what have they done with my work  time presses  i must finish those shoes    they looked at one another  and their hearts died within them    come  come   said he  in a whimpering miserable way   let me get to work  give me my work    receiving no answer  he tore his hair  and beat his feet upon the ground  like a distracted child    don t torture a poor forlorn wretch   he implored them  with a dreadful cry   but give me my work  what is to become of us  if those shoes are not done to night    lost  utterly lost   it was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him  or try to restore him  that  as if by agreement  they each put a hand upon his shoulder  and soothed him to sit down before the fire  with a promise that he should have his work presently  he sank into the chair  and brooded over the embers  and shed tears  as if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy  or a dream  mr  lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that defarge had had in keeping   affected  and impressed with terror as they both were  by this spectacle of ruin  it was not a time to yield to such emotions  his lonely daughter  bereft of her final hope and reliance  appealed to them both too strongly  again  as if by agreement  they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces  carton was the first to speak    the last chance is gone  it was not much  yes  he had better be taken to her  but  before you go  will you  for a moment  steadily attend to me  don t ask me why i make the stipulations i am going to make  and exact the promise i am going to exact  i have a reason  a good one     i do not doubt it   answered mr  lorry   say on    the figure in the chair between them  was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro  and moaning  they spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick bed in the night   carton stooped to pick up the coat  which lay almost entangling his feet  as he did so  a small case in which the doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his day s duties  fell lightly on the floor  carton took it up  and there was a folded paper in it   we should look at this   he said  mr  lorry nodded his consent  he opened it  and exclaimed   thank god     what is it   asked mr  lorry  eagerly    a moment  let me speak of it in its place  first   he put his hand in his coat  and took another paper from it   that is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city  look at it  you see  sydney carton  an englishman    mr  lorry held it open in his hand  gazing in his earnest face    keep it for me until to morrow  i shall see him to morrow  you remember  and i had better not take it into the prison     why not     i don t know  i prefer not to do so  now  take this paper that doctor manette has carried about him  it is a similar certificate  enabling him and his daughter and her child  at any time  to pass the barrier and the frontier  you see     yes     perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil  yesterday  when is it dated  but no matter  don t stay to look  put it up carefully with mine and your own  now  observe  i never doubted until within this hour or two  that he had  or could have such a paper  it is good  until recalled  but it may be soon recalled  and  i have reason to think  will be     they are not in danger     they are in great danger  they are in danger of denunciation by madame defarge  i know it from her own lips  i have overheard words of that woman s  to night  which have presented their danger to me in strong colours  i have lost no time  and since then  i have seen the spy  he confirms me  he knows that a wood sawyer  living by the prison wall  is under the control of the defarges  and has been rehearsed by madame defarge as to his having seen her   he never mentioned lucie s name   making signs and signals to prisoners  it is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one  a prison plot  and that it will involve her life  and perhaps her child s  and perhaps her father s  for both have been seen with her at that place  don t look so horrified  you will save them all     heaven grant i may  carton  but how     i am going to tell you how  it will depend on you  and it could depend on no better man  this new denunciation will certainly not take place until after to morrow  probably not until two or three days afterwards  more probably a week afterwards  you know it is a capital crime  to mourn for  or sympathise with  a victim of the guillotine  she and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime  and this woman  the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described  would wait to add that strength to her case  and make herself doubly sure  you follow me     so attentively  and with so much confidence in what you say  that for the moment i lose sight   touching the back of the doctor s chair   even of this distress     you have money  and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made  your preparations have been completed for some days  to return to england  early to morrow have your horses ready  so that they may be in starting trim at two o clock in the afternoon     it shall be done    his manner was so fervent and inspiring  that mr  lorry caught the flame  and was as quick as youth    you are a noble heart  did i say we could depend upon no better man  tell her  to night  what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father  dwell upon that  for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband s cheerfully   he faltered for an instant  then went on as before   for the sake of her child and her father  press upon her the necessity of leaving paris  with them and you  at that hour  tell her that it was her husband s last arrangement  tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe  or hope  you think that her father  even in this sad state  will submit himself to her  do you not     i am sure of it     i thought so  quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here  even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage  the moment i come to you  take me in  and drive away     i understand that i wait for you under all circumstances     you have my certificate in your hand with the rest  you know  and will reserve my place  wait for nothing but to have my place occupied  and then for england     why  then   said mr  lorry  grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand   it does not all depend on one old man  but i shall have a young and ardent man at my side     by the help of heaven you shall  promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another     nothing  carton     remember these words to morrow  change the course  or delay in it  for any reason  and no life can possibly be saved  and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed     i will remember them  i hope to do my part faithfully     and i hope to do mine  now  good bye    though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness  and though he even put the old man s hand to his lips  he did not part from him then  he helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers  as to get a cloak and hat put upon it  and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have  he walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart  so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it  outwatched the awful night  he entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone  looking up at the light in the window of her room  before he went away  he breathed a blessing towards it  and a farewell      xiii  fifty two   in the black prison of the conciergerie  the doomed of the day awaited their fate  they were in number as the weeks of the year  fifty two were to roll that afternoon on the life tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea  before their cells were quit of them  new occupants were appointed  before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday  the blood that was to mingle with theirs to morrow was already set apart   two score and twelve were told off  from the farmer general of seventy  whose riches could not buy his life  to the seamstress of twenty  whose poverty and obscurity could not save her  physical diseases  engendered in the vices and neglects of men  will seize on victims of all degrees  and the frightful moral disorder  born of unspeakable suffering  intolerable oppression  and heartless indifference  smote equally without distinction   charles darnay  alone in a cell  had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal  in every line of the narrative he had heard  he had heard his condemnation  he had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him  that he was virtually sentenced by the millions  and that units could avail him nothing   nevertheless  it was not easy  with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him  to compose his mind to what it must bear  his hold on life was strong  and it was very  very hard  to loosen  by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here  it clenched the tighter there  and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded  this was closed again  there was a hurry  too  in all his thoughts  a turbulent and heated working of his heart  that contended against resignation  if  for a moment  he did feel resigned  then his wife and child who had to live after him  seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing   but  all this was at first  before long  the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet  and that numbers went the same road wrongfully  and trod it firmly every day  sprang up to stimulate him  next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones  depended on his quiet fortitude  so  by degrees he calmed into the better state  when he could raise his thoughts much higher  and draw comfort down   before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation  he had travelled thus far on his last way  being allowed to purchase the means of writing  and a light  he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished   he wrote a long letter to lucie  showing her that he had known nothing of her father s imprisonment  until he had heard of it from herself  and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father s and uncle s responsibility for that misery  until the paper had been read  he had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished  was the one condition  fully intelligible now  that her father had attached to their betrothal  and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage  he entreated her  for her father s sake  never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper  or had had it recalled to him  for the moment  or for good   by the story of the tower  on that old sunday under the dear old plane tree in the garden  if he had preserved any definite remembrance of it  there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the bastille  when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there  and which had been described to all the world  he besought her  though he added that he knew it was needless  to console her father  by impressing him through every tender means she could think of  with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself  but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes  next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing  and her overcoming of her sorrow  to devote herself to their dear child  he adjured her  as they would meet in heaven  to comfort her father   to her father himself  he wrote in the same strain  but  he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care  and he told him this  very strongly  with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending   to mr  lorry  he commended them all  and explained his worldly affairs  that done  with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment  all was done  he never thought of carton  his mind was so full of the others  that he never once thought of him   he had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out  when he lay down on his straw bed  he thought he had done with this world   but  it beckoned him back in his sleep  and showed itself in shining forms  free and happy  back in the old house in soho  though it had nothing in it like the real house   unaccountably released and light of heart  he was with lucie again  and she told him it was all a dream  and he had never gone away  a pause of forgetfulness  and then he had even suffered  and had come back to her  dead and at peace  and yet there was no difference in him  another pause of oblivion  and he awoke in the sombre morning  unconscious where he was or what had happened  until it flashed upon his mind   this is the day of my death    thus  had he come through the hours  to the day when the fifty two heads were to fall  and now  while he was composed  and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism  a new action began in his waking thoughts  which was very difficult to master   he had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life  how high it was from the ground  how many steps it had  where he would be stood  how he would be touched  whether the touching hands would be dyed red  which way his face would be turned  whether he would be the first  or might be the last  these and many similar questions  in nowise directed by his will  obtruded themselves over and over again  countless times  neither were they connected with fear  he was conscious of no fear  rather  they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came  a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred  a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his  than his own   the hours went on as he walked to and fro  and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again  nine gone for ever  ten gone for ever  eleven gone for ever  twelve coming on to pass away  after a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him  he had got the better of it  he walked up and down  softly repeating their names to himself  the worst of the strife was over  he could walk up and down  free from distracting fancies  praying for himself and for them   twelve gone for ever   he had been apprised that the final hour was three  and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier  inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets  therefore  he resolved to keep two before his mind  as the hour  and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able  after that time  to strengthen others   walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast  a very different man from the prisoner  who had walked to and fro at la force  he heard one struck away from him  without surprise  the hour had measured like most other hours  devoutly thankful to heaven for his recovered self possession  he thought   there is but another now   and turned to walk again   footsteps in the stone passage outside the door  he stopped   the key was put in the lock  and turned  before the door was opened  or as it opened  a man said in a low voice  in english   he has never seen me here  i have kept out of his way  go you in alone  i wait near  lose no time    the door was quickly opened and closed  and there stood before him face to face  quiet  intent upon him  with the light of a smile on his features  and a cautionary finger on his lip  sydney carton   there was something so bright and remarkable in his look  that  for the first moment  the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining  but  he spoke  and it was his voice  he took the prisoner s hand  and it was his real grasp    of all the people upon earth  you least expected to see me   he said    i could not believe it to be you  i can scarcely believe it now  you are not   the apprehension came suddenly into his mind   a prisoner     no  i am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here  and in virtue of it i stand before you  i come from her  your wife  dear darnay    the prisoner wrung his hand    i bring you a request from her     what is it     a most earnest  pressing  and emphatic entreaty  addressed to you in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you  that you well remember    the prisoner turned his face partly aside    you have no time to ask me why i bring it  or what it means  i have no time to tell you  you must comply with it  take off those boots you wear  and draw on these of mine    there was a chair against the wall of the cell  behind the prisoner  carton  pressing forward  had already  with the speed of lightning  got him down into it  and stood over him  barefoot    draw on these boots of mine  put your hands to them  put your will to them  quick     carton  there is no escaping from this place  it never can be done  you will only die with me  it is madness     it would be madness if i asked you to escape  but do i  when i ask you to pass out at that door  tell me it is madness and remain here  change that cravat for this of mine  that coat for this of mine  while you do it  let me take this ribbon from your hair  and shake out your hair like this of mine    with wonderful quickness  and with a strength both of will and action  that appeared quite supernatural  he forced all these changes upon him  the prisoner was like a young child in his hands    carton  dear carton  it is madness  it cannot be accomplished  it never can be done  it has been attempted  and has always failed  i implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine     do i ask you  my dear darnay  to pass the door  when i ask that  refuse  there are pen and ink and paper on this table  is your hand steady enough to write     it was when you came in     steady it again  and write what i shall dictate  quick  friend  quick    pressing his hand to his bewildered head  darnay sat down at the table  carton  with his right hand in his breast  stood close beside him    write exactly as i speak     to whom do i address it     to no one   carton still had his hand in his breast    do i date it     no    the prisoner looked up  at each question  carton  standing over him with his hand in his breast  looked down     if you remember    said carton  dictating    the words that passed between us  long ago  you will readily comprehend this when you see it  you do remember them  i know  it is not in your nature to forget them     he was drawing his hand from his breast  the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote  the hand stopped  closing upon something    have you written  forget them    carton asked    i have  is that a weapon in your hand     no  i am not armed     what is it in your hand     you shall know directly  write on  there are but a few words more   he dictated again    i am thankful that the time has come  when i can prove them  that i do so is no subject for regret or grief    as he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer  his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer s face   the pen dropped from darnay s fingers on the table  and he looked about him vacantly    what vapour is that   he asked    vapour     something that crossed me     i am conscious of nothing  there can be nothing here  take up the pen and finish  hurry  hurry    as if his memory were impaired  or his faculties disordered  the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention  as he looked at carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing  carton  his hand again in his breast  looked steadily at him    hurry  hurry    the prisoner bent over the paper  once more     if it had been otherwise    carton s hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down    i never should have used the longer opportunity  if it had been otherwise    the hand was at the prisoner s face    i should but have had so much the more to answer for  if it had been otherwise     carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs   carton s hand moved back to his breast no more  the prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look  but carton s hand was close and firm at his nostrils  and carton s left arm caught him round the waist  for a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him  but  within a minute or so  he was stretched insensible on the ground   quickly  but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was  carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside  combed back his hair  and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn  then  he softly called   enter there  come in   and the spy presented himself    you see   said carton  looking up  as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure  putting the paper in the breast   is your hazard very great     mr  carton   the spy answered  with a timid snap of his fingers   my hazard is not that  in the thick of business here  if you are true to the whole of your bargain     don t fear me  i will be true to the death     you must be  mr  carton  if the tale of fifty two is to be right  being made right by you in that dress  i shall have no fear     have no fear  i shall soon be out of the way of harming you  and the rest will soon be far from here  please god  now  get assistance and take me to the coach     you   said the spy nervously    him  man  with whom i have exchanged  you go out at the gate by which you brought me in     of course     i was weak and faint when you brought me in  and i am fainter now you take me out  the parting interview has overpowered me  such a thing has happened here  often  and too often  your life is in your own hands  quick  call assistance     you swear not to betray me   said the trembling spy  as he paused for a last moment    man  man   returned carton  stamping his foot   have i sworn by no solemn vow already  to go through with this  that you waste the precious moments now  take him yourself to the courtyard you know of  place him yourself in the carriage  show him yourself to mr  lorry  tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air  and to remember my words of last night  and his promise of last night  and drive away    the spy withdrew  and carton seated himself at the table  resting his forehead on his hands  the spy returned immediately  with two men    how  then   said one of them  contemplating the fallen figure   so afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of sainte guillotine     a good patriot   said the other   could hardly have been more afflicted if the aristocrat had drawn a blank    they raised the unconscious figure  placed it on a litter they had brought to the door  and bent to carry it away    the time is short  evrémonde   said the spy  in a warning voice    i know it well   answered carton   be careful of my friend  i entreat you  and leave me     come  then  my children   said barsad   lift him  and come away    the door closed  and carton was left alone  straining his powers of listening to the utmost  he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm  there was none  keys turned  doors clashed  footsteps passed along distant passages  no cry was raised  or hurry made  that seemed unusual  breathing more freely in a little while  he sat down at the table  and listened again until the clock struck two   sounds that he was not afraid of  for he divined their meaning  then began to be audible  several doors were opened in succession  and finally his own  a gaoler  with a list in his hand  looked in  merely saying   follow me  evrémonde   and he followed into a large dark room  at a distance  it was a dark winter day  and what with the shadows within  and what with the shadows without  he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound  some were standing  some seated  some were lamenting  and in restless motion  but  these were few  the great majority were silent and still  looking fixedly at the ground   as he stood by the wall in a dim corner  while some of the fifty two were brought in after him  one man stopped in passing  to embrace him  as having a knowledge of him  it thrilled him with a great dread of discovery  but the man went on  a very few moments after that  a young woman  with a slight girlish form  a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour  and large widely opened patient eyes  rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting  and came to speak to him    citizen evrémonde   she said  touching him with her cold hand   i am a poor little seamstress  who was with you in la force    he murmured for answer   true  i forget what you were accused of     plots  though the just heaven knows that i am innocent of any  is it likely  who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me    the forlorn smile with which she said it  so touched him  that tears started from his eyes    i am not afraid to die  citizen evrémonde  but i have done nothing  i am not unwilling to die  if the republic which is to do so much good to us poor  will profit by my death  but i do not know how that can be  citizen evrémonde  such a poor weak little creature    as the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to  it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl    i heard you were released  citizen evrémonde  i hoped it was true     it was  but  i was again taken and condemned     if i may ride with you  citizen evrémonde  will you let me hold your hand  i am not afraid  but i am little and weak  and it will give me more courage    as the patient eyes were lifted to his face  he saw a sudden doubt in them  and then astonishment  he pressed the work worn  hunger worn young fingers  and touched his lips    are you dying for him   she whispered    and his wife and child  hush  yes     o you will let me hold your brave hand  stranger     hush  yes  my poor sister  to the last                   the same shadows that are falling on the prison  are falling  in that same hour of the early afternoon  on the barrier with the crowd about it  when a coach going out of paris drives up to be examined    who goes here  whom have we within  papers    the papers are handed out  and read    alexandre manette  physician  french  which is he    this is he  this helpless  inarticulately murmuring  wandering old man pointed out    apparently the citizen doctor is not in his right mind  the revolution fever will have been too much for him    greatly too much for him    hah  many suffer with it  lucie  his daughter  french  which is she    this is she    apparently it must be  lucie  the wife of evrémonde  is it not    it is    hah  evrémonde has an assignation elsewhere  lucie  her child  english  this is she    she and no other    kiss me  child of evrémonde  now  thou hast kissed a good republican  something new in thy family  remember it  sydney carton  advocate  english  which is he    he lies here  in this corner of the carriage  he  too  is pointed out    apparently the english advocate is in a swoon    it is hoped he will recover in the fresher air  it is represented that he is not in strong health  and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the republic    is that all  it is not a great deal  that  many are under the displeasure of the republic  and must look out at the little window  jarvis lorry  banker  english  which is he     i am he  necessarily  being the last    it is jarvis lorry who has replied to all the previous questions  it is jarvis lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door  replying to a group of officials  they leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box  to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof  the country people hanging about  press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in  a little child  carried by its mother  has its short arm held out for it  that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the guillotine    behold your papers  jarvis lorry  countersigned     one can depart  citizen     one can depart  forward  my postilions  a good journey     i salute you  citizens   and the first danger passed    these are again the words of jarvis lorry  as he clasps his hands  and looks upward  there is terror in the carriage  there is weeping  there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller    are we not going too slowly  can they not be induced to go faster    asks lucie  clinging to the old man    it would seem like flight  my darling  i must not urge them too much  it would rouse suspicion     look back  look back  and see if we are pursued     the road is clear  my dearest  so far  we are not pursued    houses in twos and threes pass by us  solitary farms  ruinous buildings  dye works  tanneries  and the like  open country  avenues of leafless trees  the hard uneven pavement is under us  the soft deep mud is on either side  sometimes  we strike into the skirting mud  to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us  sometimes  we stick in ruts and sloughs there  the agony of our impatience is then so great  that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running  hiding  doing anything but stopping   out of the open country  in again among ruinous buildings  solitary farms  dye works  tanneries  and the like  cottages in twos and threes  avenues of leafless trees  have these men deceived us  and taken us back by another road  is not this the same place twice over  thank heaven  no  a village  look back  look back  and see if we are pursued  hush  the posting house   leisurely  our four horses are taken out  leisurely  the coach stands in the little street  bereft of horses  and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again  leisurely  the new horses come into visible existence  one by one  leisurely  the new postilions follow  sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips  leisurely  the old postilions count their money  make wrong additions  and arrive at dissatisfied results  all the time  our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled   at length the new postilions are in their saddles  and the old are left behind  we are through the village  up the hill  and down the hill  and on the low watery grounds  suddenly  the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation  and the horses are pulled up  almost on their haunches  we are pursued    ho  within the carriage there  speak then     what is it   asks mr  lorry  looking out at window    how many did they say     i do not understand you       at the last post  how many to the guillotine to day     fifty two     i said so  a brave number  my fellow citizen here would have it forty two  ten more heads are worth having  the guillotine goes handsomely  i love it  hi forward  whoop    the night comes on dark  he moves more  he is beginning to revive  and to speak intelligibly  he thinks they are still together  he asks him  by his name  what he has in his hand  o pity us  kind heaven  and help us  look out  look out  and see if we are pursued   the wind is rushing after us  and the clouds are flying after us  and the moon is plunging after us  and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us  but  so far  we are pursued by nothing else      xiv  the knitting done   in that same juncture of time when the fifty two awaited their fate madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and jacques three of the revolutionary jury  not in the wine shop did madame defarge confer with these ministers  but in the shed of the wood sawyer  erst a mender of roads  the sawyer himself did not participate in the conference  but abided at a little distance  like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required  or to offer an opinion until invited    but our defarge   said jacques three   is undoubtedly a good republican  eh     there is no better   the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill notes   in france     peace  little vengeance   said madame defarge  laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant s lips   hear me speak  my husband  fellow citizen  is a good republican and a bold man  he has deserved well of the republic  and possesses its confidence  but my husband has his weaknesses  and he is so weak as to relent towards this doctor     it is a great pity   croaked jacques three  dubiously shaking his head  with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth   it is not quite like a good citizen  it is a thing to regret     see you   said madame   i care nothing for this doctor  i  he may wear his head or lose it  for any interest i have in him  it is all one to me  but  the evrémonde people are to be exterminated  and the wife and child must follow the husband and father     she has a fine head for it   croaked jacques three   i have seen blue eyes and golden hair there  and they looked charming when samson held them up   ogre that he was  he spoke like an epicure   madame defarge cast down her eyes  and reflected a little    the child also   observed jacques three  with a meditative enjoyment of his words   has golden hair and blue eyes  and we seldom have a child there  it is a pretty sight     in a word   said madame defarge  coming out of her short abstraction   i cannot trust my husband in this matter  not only do i feel  since last night  that i dare not confide to him the details of my projects  but also i feel that if i delay  there is danger of his giving warning  and then they might escape     that must never be   croaked jacques three   no one must escape  we have not half enough as it is  we ought to have six score a day     in a word   madame defarge went on   my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation  and i have not his reason for regarding this doctor with any sensibility  i must act for myself  therefore  come hither  little citizen    the wood sawyer  who held her in the respect  and himself in the submission  of mortal fear  advanced with his hand to his red cap    touching those signals  little citizen   said madame defarge  sternly   that she made to the prisoners  you are ready to bear witness to them this very day     ay  ay  why not   cried the sawyer   every day  in all weathers  from two to four  always signalling  sometimes with the little one  sometimes without  i know what i know  i have seen with my eyes    he made all manner of gestures while he spoke  as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen    clearly plots   said jacques three   transparently     there is no doubt of the jury   inquired madame defarge  letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile    rely upon the patriotic jury  dear citizeness  i answer for my fellow jurymen     now  let me see   said madame defarge  pondering again   yet once more  can i spare this doctor to my husband  i have no feeling either way  can i spare him     he would count as one head   observed jacques three  in a low voice   we really have not heads enough  it would be a pity  i think     he was signalling with her when i saw her   argued madame defarge   i cannot speak of one without the other  and i must not be silent  and trust the case wholly to him  this little citizen here  for  i am not a bad witness    the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses  the little citizen  not to be outdone  declared her to be a celestial witness    he must take his chance   said madame defarge   no  i cannot spare him  you are engaged at three o clock  you are going to see the batch of to day executed   you    the question was addressed to the wood sawyer  who hurriedly replied in the affirmative  seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of republicans  and that he would be in effect the most desolate of republicans  if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber  he was so very demonstrative herein  that he might have been suspected  perhaps was  by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of madame defarge s head  of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety  every hour in the day    i   said madame   am equally engaged at the same place  after it is over  say at eight to night  come you to me  in saint antoine  and we will give information against these people at my section    the wood sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness  the citizeness looking at him  he became embarrassed  evaded her glance as a small dog would have done  retreated among his wood  and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw   madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a little nearer to the door  and there expounded her further views to them thus    she will now be at home  awaiting the moment of his death  she will be mourning and grieving  she will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the republic  she will be full of sympathy with its enemies  i will go to her     what an admirable woman  what an adorable woman   exclaimed jacques three  rapturously   ah  my cherished   cried the vengeance  and embraced her    take you my knitting   said madame defarge  placing it in her lieutenant s hands   and have it ready for me in my usual seat  keep me my usual chair  go you there  straight  for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual  to day     i willingly obey the orders of my chief   said the vengeance with alacrity  and kissing her cheek   you will not be late     i shall be there before the commencement     and before the tumbrils arrive  be sure you are there  my soul   said the vengeance  calling after her  for she had already turned into the street   before the tumbrils arrive    madame defarge slightly waved her hand  to imply that she heard  and might be relied upon to arrive in good time  and so went through the mud  and round the corner of the prison wall  the vengeance and the juryman  looking after her as she walked away  were highly appreciative of her fine figure  and her superb moral endowments   there were many women at that time  upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand  but  there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman  now taking her way along the streets  of a strong and fearless character  of shrewd sense and readiness  of great determination  of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity  but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities  the troubled time would have heaved her up  under any circumstances  but  imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong  and an inveterate hatred of a class  opportunity had developed her into a tigress  she was absolutely without pity  if she had ever had the virtue in her  it had quite gone out of her   it was nothing to her  that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers  she saw  not him  but them  it was nothing to her  that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan  that was insufficient punishment  because they were her natural enemies and her prey  and as such had no right to live  to appeal to her  was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity  even for herself  if she had been laid low in the streets  in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged  she would not have pitied herself  nor  if she had been ordered to the axe to morrow  would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there   such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe  carelessly worn  it was a becoming robe enough  in a certain weird way  and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap  lying hidden in her bosom  was a loaded pistol  lying hidden at her waist  was a sharpened dagger  thus accoutred  and walking with the confident tread of such a character  and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood  bare foot and bare legged  on the brown sea sand  madame defarge took her way along the streets   now  when the journey of the travelling coach  at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load  had been planned out last night  the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engaged mr  lorry s attention  it was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach  but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers  should be reduced to the utmost  since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there  finally  he had proposed  after anxious consideration  that miss pross and jerry  who were at liberty to leave the city  should leave it at three o clock in the lightest wheeled conveyance known to that period  unencumbered with luggage  they would soon overtake the coach  and  passing it and preceding it on the road  would order its horses in advance  and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night  when delay was the most to be dreaded   seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency  miss pross hailed it with joy  she and jerry had beheld the coach start  had known who it was that solomon brought  had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense  and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach  even as madame defarge  taking her way through the streets  now drew nearer and nearer to the else deserted lodging in which they held their consultation    now what do you think  mr  cruncher   said miss pross  whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak  or stand  or move  or live   what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard  another carriage having already gone from here to day  it might awaken suspicion     my opinion  miss   returned mr  cruncher   is as you re right  likewise wot i ll stand by you  right or wrong     i am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures   said miss pross  wildly crying   that i am incapable of forming any plan  are you capable of forming any plan  my dear good mr  cruncher     respectin  a future spear o  life  miss   returned mr  cruncher   i hope so  respectin  any present use o  this here blessed old head o  mine  i think not  would you do me the favour  miss  to take notice o  two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis     oh  for gracious sake   cried miss pross  still wildly crying   record them at once  and get them out of the way  like an excellent man     first   said mr  cruncher  who was all in a tremble  and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage   them poor things well out o  this  never no more will i do it  never no more     i am quite sure  mr  cruncher   returned miss pross   that you never will do it again  whatever it is  and i beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is     no  miss   returned jerry   it shall not be named to you  second  them poor things well out o  this  and never no more will i interfere with mrs  cruncher s flopping  never no more     whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be   said miss pross  striving to dry her eyes and compose herself   i have no doubt it is best that mrs  cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence   o my poor darlings     i go so far as to say  miss  moreover   proceeded mr  cruncher  with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit   and let my words be took down and took to mrs  cruncher through yourself  that wot my opinions respectin  flopping has undergone a change  and that wot i only hope with all my heart as mrs  cruncher may be a flopping at the present time     there  there  there  i hope she is  my dear man   cried the distracted miss pross   and i hope she finds it answering her expectations     forbid it   proceeded mr  cruncher  with additional solemnity  additional slowness  and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out   as anything wot i have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now  forbid it as we shouldn t all flop  if it was anyways conwenient  to get  em out o  this here dismal risk  forbid it  miss  wot i say  for bid it   this was mr  cruncher s conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one   and still madame defarge  pursuing her way along the streets  came nearer and nearer    if we ever get back to our native land   said miss pross   you may rely upon my telling mrs  cruncher as much as i may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said  and at all events you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time  now  pray let us think  my esteemed mr  cruncher  let us think    still  madame defarge  pursuing her way along the streets  came nearer and nearer    if you were to go before   said miss pross   and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here  and were to wait somewhere for me  wouldn t that be best    mr  cruncher thought it might be best    where could you wait for me   asked miss pross   mr  cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but temple bar  alas  temple bar was hundreds of miles away  and madame defarge was drawing very near indeed    by the cathedral door   said miss pross   would it be much out of the way  to take me in  near the great cathedral door between the two towers     no  miss   answered mr  cruncher    then  like the best of men   said miss pross   go to the posting house straight  and make that change     i am doubtful   said mr  cruncher  hesitating and shaking his head   about leaving of you  you see  we don t know what may happen     heaven knows we don t   returned miss pross   but have no fear for me  take me in at the cathedral  at three o clock  or as near it as you can  and i am sure it will be better than our going from here  i feel certain of it  there  bless you  mr  cruncher  think not of me  but of the lives that may depend on both of us    this exordium  and miss pross s two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his  decided mr  cruncher  with an encouraging nod or two  he immediately went out to alter the arrangements  and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed   the having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution  was a great relief to miss pross  the necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets  was another relief  she looked at her watch  and it was twenty minutes past two  she had no time to lose  but must get ready at once   afraid  in her extreme perturbation  of the loneliness of the deserted rooms  and of half imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them  miss pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes  which were swollen and red  haunted by her feverish apprehensions  she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water  but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her  in one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out  for she saw a figure standing in the room   the basin fell to the ground broken  and the water flowed to the feet of madame defarge  by strange stern ways  and through much staining blood  those feet had come to meet that water   madame defarge looked coldly at her  and said   the wife of evrémonde  where is she    it flashed upon miss pross s mind that the doors were all standing open  and would suggest the flight  her first act was to shut them  there were four in the room  and she shut them all  she then placed herself before the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied   madame defarge s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement  and rested on her when it was finished  miss pross had nothing beautiful about her  years had not tamed the wildness  or softened the grimness  of her appearance  but  she too was a determined woman in her different way  and she measured madame defarge with her eyes  every inch    you might  from your appearance  be the wife of lucifer   said miss pross  in her breathing   nevertheless  you shall not get the better of me  i am an englishwoman    madame defarge looked at her scornfully  but still with something of miss pross s own perception that they two were at bay  she saw a tight  hard  wiry woman before her  as mr  lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand  in the years gone by  she knew full well that miss pross was the family s devoted friend  miss pross knew full well that madame defarge was the family s malevolent enemy    on my way yonder   said madame defarge  with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot   where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me  i am come to make my compliments to her in passing  i wish to see her     i know that your intentions are evil   said miss pross   and you may depend upon it  i ll hold my own against them    each spoke in her own language  neither understood the other s words  both were very watchful  and intent to deduce from look and manner  what the unintelligible words meant    it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment   said madame defarge   good patriots will know what that means  let me see her  go tell her that i wish to see her  do you hear     if those eyes of yours were bed winches   returned miss pross   and i was an english four poster  they shouldn t loose a splinter of me  no  you wicked foreign woman  i am your match    madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail  but  she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught    woman imbecile and pig like   said madame defarge  frowning   i take no answer from you  i demand to see her  either tell her that i demand to see her  or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her    this  with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm    i little thought   said miss pross   that i should ever want to understand your nonsensical language  but i would give all i have  except the clothes i wear  to know whether you suspect the truth  or any part of it    neither of them for a single moment released the other s eyes  madame defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross first became aware of her  but  she now advanced one step    i am a briton   said miss pross   i am desperate  i don t care an english twopence for myself  i know that the longer i keep you here  the greater hope there is for my ladybird  i ll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head  if you lay a finger on me    thus miss pross  with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence  and every rapid sentence a whole breath  thus miss pross  who had never struck a blow in her life   but  her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes  this was a courage that madame defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness   ha  ha   she laughed   you poor wretch  what are you worth  i address myself to that doctor   then she raised her voice and called out   citizen doctor  wife of evrémonde  child of evrémonde  any person but this miserable fool  answer the citizeness defarge    perhaps the following silence  perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of miss pross s face  perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion  whispered to madame defarge that they were gone  three of the doors she opened swiftly  and looked in    those rooms are all in disorder  there has been hurried packing  there are odds and ends upon the ground  there is no one in that room behind you  let me look     never   said miss pross  who understood the request as perfectly as madame defarge understood the answer    if they are not in that room  they are gone  and can be pursued and brought back   said madame defarge to herself    as long as you don t know whether they are in that room or not  you are uncertain what to do   said miss pross to herself   and you shall not know that  if i can prevent your knowing it  and know that  or not know that  you shall not leave here while i can hold you     i have been in the streets from the first  nothing has stopped me  i will tear you to pieces  but i will have you from that door   said madame defarge    we are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard  we are not likely to be heard  and i pray for bodily strength to keep you here  while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling   said miss pross   madame defarge made at the door  miss pross  on the instinct of the moment  seized her round the waist in both her arms  and held her tight  it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike  miss pross  with the vigorous tenacity of love  always so much stronger than hate  clasped her tight  and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had  the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and tore her face  but  miss pross  with her head down  held her round the waist  and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman   soon  madame defarge s hands ceased to strike  and felt at her encircled waist   it is under my arm   said miss pross  in smothered tones   you shall not draw it  i am stronger than you  i bless heaven for it  i hold you till one or other of us faints or dies    madame defarge s hands were at her bosom  miss pross looked up  saw what it was  struck at it  struck out a flash and a crash  and stood alone  blinded with smoke   all this was in a second  as the smoke cleared  leaving an awful stillness  it passed out on the air  like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground   in the first fright and horror of her situation  miss pross passed the body as far from it as she could  and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help  happily  she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did  in time to check herself and go back  it was dreadful to go in at the door again  but  she did go in  and even went near it  to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear  these she put on  out on the staircase  first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key  she then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry  and then got up and hurried away   by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet  or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped  by good fortune  too  she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman  she needed both advantages  for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face  and her hair was torn  and her dress  hastily composed with unsteady hands  was clutched and dragged a hundred ways   in crossing the bridge  she dropped the door key in the river  arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort  and waiting there  she thought  what if the key were already taken in a net  what if it were identified  what if the door were opened and the remains discovered  what if she were stopped at the gate  sent to prison  and charged with murder  in the midst of these fluttering thoughts  the escort appeared  took her in  and took her away    is there any noise in the streets   she asked him    the usual noises   mr  cruncher replied  and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect    i don t hear you   said miss pross   what do you say    it was in vain for mr  cruncher to repeat what he said  miss pross could not hear him   so i ll nod my head   thought mr  cruncher  amazed   at all events she ll see that   and she did    is there any noise in the streets now   asked miss pross again  presently   again mr  cruncher nodded his head    i don t hear it     gone deaf in an hour   said mr  cruncher  ruminating  with his mind much disturbed   wot s come to her     i feel   said miss pross   as if there had been a flash and a crash  and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life     blest if she ain t in a queer condition   said mr  cruncher  more and more disturbed   wot can she have been a takin   to keep her courage up  hark  there s the roll of them dreadful carts  you can hear that  miss     i can hear   said miss pross  seeing that he spoke to her   nothing  o  my good man  there was first a great crash  and then a great stillness  and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable  never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts     if she don t hear the roll of those dreadful carts  now very nigh their journey s end   said mr  cruncher  glancing over his shoulder   it s my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world    and indeed she never did      xv  the footsteps die out for ever   along the paris streets  the death carts rumble  hollow and harsh  six tumbrils carry the day s wine to la guillotine  all the devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could record itself  are fused in the one realisation  guillotine  and yet there is not in france  with its rich variety of soil and climate  a blade  a leaf  a root  a sprig  a peppercorn  which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror  crush humanity out of shape once more  under similar hammers  and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms  sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again  and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind   six tumbrils roll along the streets  change these back again to what they were  thou powerful enchanter  time  and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs  the equipages of feudal nobles  the toilettes of flaring jezebels  the churches that are not my father s house but dens of thieves  the huts of millions of starving peasants  no  the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the creator  never reverses his transformations   if thou be changed into this shape by the will of god   say the seers to the enchanted  in the wise arabian stories   then remain so  but  if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration  then resume thy former aspect    changeless and hopeless  the tumbrils roll along   as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round  they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets  ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that  and the ploughs go steadily onward  so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle  that in many windows there are no people  and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended  while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils  here and there  the inmate has visitors to see the sight  then he points his finger  with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent  to this cart and to this  and seems to tell who sat here yesterday  and who there the day before   of the riders in the tumbrils  some observe these things  and all things on their last roadside  with an impassive stare  others  with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men  some  seated with drooping heads  are sunk in silent despair  again  there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres  and in pictures  several close their eyes  and think  or try to get their straying thoughts together  only one  and he a miserable creature  of a crazed aspect  is so shattered and made drunk by horror  that he sings  and tries to dance  not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture  to the pity of the people   there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils  and faces are often turned up to some of them  and they are asked some question  it would seem to be always the same question  for  it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart  the horsemen abreast of that cart  frequently point out one man in it with their swords  the leading curiosity is  to know which is he  he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down  to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart  and holds his hand  he has no curiosity or care for the scene about him  and always speaks to the girl  here and there in the long street of st  honore  cries are raised against him  if they move him at all  it is only to a quiet smile  as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face  he cannot easily touch his face  his arms being bound   on the steps of a church  awaiting the coming up of the tumbrils  stands the spy and prison sheep  he looks into the first of them  not there  he looks into the second  not there  he already asks himself   has he sacrificed me   when his face clears  as he looks into the third    which is evrémonde   says a man behind him    that  at the back there     with his hand in the girl s     yes    the man cries   down  evrémonde  to the guillotine all aristocrats  down  evrémonde     hush  hush   the spy entreats him  timidly    and why not  citizen     he is going to pay the forfeit  it will be paid in five minutes more  let him be at peace    but the man continuing to exclaim   down  evrémonde   the face of evrémonde is for a moment turned towards him  evrémonde then sees the spy  and looks attentively at him  and goes his way   the clocks are on the stroke of three  and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round  to come on into the place of execution  and end  the ridges thrown to this side and to that  now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on  for all are following to the guillotine  in front of it  seated in chairs  as in a garden of public diversion  are a number of women  busily knitting  on one of the fore most chairs  stands the vengeance  looking about for her friend    thérèse   she cries  in her shrill tones   who has seen her  thérèse defarge     she never missed before   says a knitting woman of the sisterhood    no  nor will she miss now   cries the vengeance  petulantly   thérèse     louder   the woman recommends   ay  louder  vengeance  much louder  and still she will scarcely hear thee  louder yet  vengeance  with a little oath or so added  and yet it will hardly bring her  send other women up and down to seek her  lingering somewhere  and yet  although the messengers have done dread deeds  it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her    bad fortune   cries the vengeance  stamping her foot in the chair   and here are the tumbrils  and evrémonde will be despatched in a wink  and she not here  see her knitting in my hand  and her empty chair ready for her  i cry with vexation and disappointment    as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it  the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads  the ministers of sainte guillotine are robed and ready  crash   a head is held up  and the knitting women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak  count one   the second tumbril empties and moves on  the third comes up  crash   and the knitting women  never faltering or pausing in their work  count two   the supposed evrémonde descends  and the seamstress is lifted out next after him  he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out  but still holds it as he promised  he gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls  and she looks into his face and thanks him    but for you  dear stranger  i should not be so composed  for i am naturally a poor little thing  faint of heart  nor should i have been able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death  that we might have hope and comfort here to day  i think you were sent to me by heaven     or you to me   says sydney carton   keep your eyes upon me  dear child  and mind no other object     i mind nothing while i hold your hand  i shall mind nothing when i let it go  if they are rapid     they will be rapid  fear not    the two stand in the fast thinning throng of victims  but they speak as if they were alone  eye to eye  voice to voice  hand to hand  heart to heart  these two children of the universal mother  else so wide apart and differing  have come together on the dark highway  to repair home together  and to rest in her bosom    brave and generous friend  will you let me ask you one last question  i am very ignorant  and it troubles me  just a little     tell me what it is     i have a cousin  an only relative and an orphan  like myself  whom i love very dearly  she is five years younger than i  and she lives in a farmer s house in the south country  poverty parted us  and she knows nothing of my fate  for i cannot write  and if i could  how should i tell her  it is better as it is     yes  yes  better as it is     what i have been thinking as we came along  and what i am still thinking now  as i look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support  is this   if the republic really does good to the poor  and they come to be less hungry  and in all ways to suffer less  she may live a long time  she may even live to be old     what then  my gentle sister     do you think   the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance  fill with tears  and the lips part a little more and tremble   that it will seem long to me  while i wait for her in the better land where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered     it cannot be  my child  there is no time there  and no trouble there     you comfort me so much  i am so ignorant  am i to kiss you now  is the moment come     yes    she kisses his lips  he kisses hers  they solemnly bless each other  the spare hand does not tremble as he releases it  nothing worse than a sweet  bright constancy is in the patient face  she goes next before him  is gone  the knitting women count twenty two    i am the resurrection and the life  saith the lord  he that believeth in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live  and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die    the murmuring of many voices  the upturning of many faces  the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd  so that it swells forward in a mass  like one great heave of water  all flashes away  twenty three                  they said of him  about the city that night  that it was the peacefullest man s face ever beheld there  many added that he looked sublime and prophetic   one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe  a woman  had asked at the foot of the same scaffold  not long before  to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her  if he had given any utterance to his  and they were prophetic  they would have been these    i see barsad  and cly  defarge  the vengeance  the juryman  the judge  long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old  perishing by this retributive instrument  before it shall cease out of its present use  i see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss  and  in their struggles to be truly free  in their triumphs and defeats  through long years to come  i see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth  gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out    i see the lives for which i lay down my life  peaceful  useful  prosperous and happy  in that england which i shall see no more  i see her with a child upon her bosom  who bears my name  i see her father  aged and bent  but otherwise restored  and faithful to all men in his healing office  and at peace  i see the good old man  so long their friend  in ten years  time enriching them with all he has  and passing tranquilly to his reward    i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts  and in the hearts of their descendants  generations hence  i see her  an old woman  weeping for me on the anniversary of this day  i see her and her husband  their course done  lying side by side in their last earthly bed  and i know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other s soul  than i was in the souls of both    i see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name  a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine  i see him winning it so well  that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his  i see the blots i threw upon it  faded away  i see him  fore most of just judges and honoured men  bringing a boy of my name  with a forehead that i know and golden hair  to this place  then fair to look upon  with not a trace of this day s disfigurement  and i hear him tell the child my story  with a tender and a faltering voice    it is a
